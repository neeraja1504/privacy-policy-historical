ASP PRIVACY POLICY
Effective March 1, 2006
This statement discloses HRsmart, Inc.'s ("HRsmart's") privacy policy with respect to the personally identifiable information ("personal information") it may maintain while operating as an application service provider ("ASP") for its clients. Any information HRsmart collects by other means, such as through the website www.hrsmart.com or off-line, is subject to a different policy and practice.
This privacy policy applies only to the personal information HRsmart maintains in its capacity as an ASP. HRsmart builds custom software applications to help clients manage their human resources information. HRsmart's clients use this software to store, manipulate and extract human resources data. Typically, clients input data to the application's database. HRsmart's clients also may permit other parties to input data, such as vendors and job applicants. Our clients, not HRsmart, control which parties may enter data to the database. Similarly, our clients, not HRsmart, control which parties, such as employees and vendors, may access the data stored in the database. If you have a question about how a particular client protects personal information, we encourage you to review its privacy policy.
HRsmart complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. HRsmart has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.
