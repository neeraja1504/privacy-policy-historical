What personal data do we collect?
We may collect some or all of the following types of information including:
Personal data. Our websites may collect personal data, information that either directly identifies you or could reasonably be used to identify you. Examples of personal data include your name, contact information, email address, and other information in combination with such identifiers.
Mobile devices information. If you access our websites on your mobile telephone or mobile device, we may also collect your unique device identifier and mobile device IP address, as well as information about your device's operating system, mobile carrier and your location information.

We use this information to learn more about how our website is used and to otherwise improve and administer the site. Automated technologies may include the use of web server logs to collect IP addresses, "cookies" and web beacons. Further information about our use of cookies can be found below in the Cookies and other tracking technologies section at the end of this Statement.
Social media:
You can engage with us through social media websites or through features such as plug-ins or applications on Human Rights Watch websites that integrate with social media sites. You may also choose to link your account with us to third party social media sites. When you link your account or engage with us on or through third-party social media sites, plug-ins, or applications, you may allow us to have ongoing access to certain information from your social media account (e.g., name, e-mail address, photo, gender, birthday, the posts or the 'likes' you make).
If you post information when you interact with our websites through social media sites, plug-ins or other applications, depending on your privacy settings, this information may become public on the Internet. You can control what information you share through privacy settings available on some social media sites. For more information about how you can customize your privacy settings and how third party social media sites handle your personally identifiable information, please refer to their privacy help guides, privacy notices and terms of use.
How do we use your personal data?
We use the personal data you provide to us to:
Provide you with personalized service;
Operate our website and understand its use, for statistical purposes (number of site visits, average time visitors spend at the site, etc.) and security purposes;
Manage and process inquiries, registrations, donations and other interactions with you;
Send you information you have requested or consented to receiving such as newsletters, breaking news, and other information regarding relevant Human Rights Watch Activities.
With whom do we share your personal data?
We do not sell, share, or otherwise disclose the information we collect through our website and mobile applications, except as provided in this Privacy Statement.
We may share your personal data with other Human Rights Watch entities, divisions, and branch offices to serve you, including for the activities listed in this statement.
We may share your personal data with our affiliates and third-party organizations which we feel could be of interest to you, provided you agree to such sharing and such sharing is legal under applicable law. Please see the section on Your choices regarding your information below if you wish to have your information shared this way.
We may disclose information to third parties who provide us with various business services, including monitoring and maintaining the websites and with whom we are working to provide you with services or information. We may also disclose information we collect in special cases, including when we have a reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or bring a legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with our rights and property or those of any other person. We may also disclose information when we believe the law requires it and in any situation that involves threats to any person’s physical safety. When required by law, such sharing of information will be subject to an agreement with each such service provider, requiring such service provider to comply with data protection requirements.
We may disclose personal data (i) if we are required to do so by law, legal process, statute, rule, regulation, or professional standard, or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant, or other legal request; (ii) in response to law enforcement authority or other government official requests; (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss; (iv) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (v) in the event that Human Rights Watch is dissolved or otherwise reorganized. Disclosure may also be required for audits or to investigate a complaint or security threat.
Further information about our use of cookies and similar technologies can be found below in the Cookies and other tracking technologies section at the end of this Statement.
Legal requirements and business transfers
We may disclose personal data (i) if we are required to do so by law, legal process, statute, rule, regulation, or professional standard, or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant, or other legal request; (ii) in response to law enforcement authority or other government official requests; (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss; (iv) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (v) in the event that Human Rights Watch is dissolved or otherwise reorganized. Disclosure may also be required for audits or to investigate a complaint or security threat.
Do we transfer your personal data across national borders?
We are a global organization and may transfer certain personal data across geographical borders to Human Rights Watch entities, authorized service providers or business partners in other countries working on our behalf in accordance with applicable law. Our affiliates and third parties may be based locally or they may be in other countries, some of which have not been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection.
When we do, we use a variety of legal mechanisms to help ensure your rights and protections travel with your data:
we ensure transfers within Human Rights Watch are covered by agreements based on the EU Commission's standard contractual clauses, which contractually oblige each member to ensure that personal data receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it resides within Human Rights Watch;
where we transfer your personal data outside Human Rights Watch or to third parties who help provide our services, we obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your personal data. Some of these assurances are well recognized certification schemes like the EU - US Privacy Shield for the protection of personal data transferred from within the EU to the United States, or the standard contractual clauses; or
where we receive requests for information from law enforcement or regulators, we carefully validate these requests before any personal data is disclosed.
Examples of countries to which we transfer personal data include, but are not limited to, the United States, the United Kingdom and India.
If you would like further information about whether your information will be disclosed to overseas recipients, please contact us as noted below. You also have a right to contact us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place (including a copy of relevant contractual commitments, which may be redacted for reasons of commercial confidentiality) to ensure the adequate protection of your personal data when this is transferred as mentioned above.
Do we collect information from children?
Our website is not intended for children under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal data from an individual under age 16. If you are under the age of 16, please do not submit any personal data through the website. If you have reason to believe that we may have accidentally received personal data from an individual under age 16, please contact us immediately at privacy@hrw.org.

When you provide us with personal details, if we intend to use those details for marketing purposes, we will provide you with the option of whether you wish to receive promotional e-mail, SMS messages, telephone calls and postal mail from us. At any time, you may opt out from receiving interest-based advertising or marketing from us by contacting us.

How long do we retain your personal data?
How long we  retain  your personal data depends on the purpose for which it was obtained and its nature. We will keep your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Statement unless a longer retention period is permitted or required by law. In specific circumstances we may store your personal data for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your personal data or dealings.
Do we have security measures in place to protect your information?
Human Rights Watch takes steps to protect your information from unauthorized access. While we take reasonable measures to protect the information you submit via the website against loss, theft, and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. No internet, email, or mobile application transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Email or other messages sent through the website may not be secure. You should use caution whenever submitting information through email or the website and take special care in deciding which information you provide us.
Are we responsible for the websites to which we link?
