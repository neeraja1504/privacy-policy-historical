H&R Block Privacy Policy - H&R Block®
H&R Block offers a wide range of tax and financial services, including tax preparation, tax planning, banking, and business services through various affiliates and franchisees. Because we offer a variety of services both online (via the Internet) and throughout H&R Block's nationwide network of offices, H&R Block's privacy practices will vary depending on how you interact with H&R Block. The following guidelines set forth general privacy principles that apply to information collected on the www.hrblock.com web site, independent of any particular business relationship you enter into with H&R Block. If you enter into a business relationship with H&R Block as our customer (such as when you are utilizing our tax preparation or other software or online tax preparation tools), we will make you aware of the privacy practices that apply to that particular business or relationship you enter into with H&R Block.
These practices do not apply to our physical offices you may visit for services, and these practices do not apply to specific relationships you may establish with H&R Block Bank, H&R Block Digital LLC, or other affiliates of H&R Block. Those H&R Block affiliates will provide you with their privacy notices when you enter into a business relationship with them. If you are a user of H&R Block's software, mobile or online tax preparation services, the "Privacy Notice for H&R Block At Home™ Tax Services " will apply to information collected by H&R Block.
