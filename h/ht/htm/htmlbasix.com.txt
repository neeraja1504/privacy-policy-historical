What information gets gathered when you hit this site:
We have a standard stats program which collects the following data:
hits to the site
which browser you use
your ip address
how many pages you access
whether or not you clicked on a link to get here
These are standard statistics of just about every website you visit. What do I do with this information? Not a lot. I just look at it sometimes. I don't collate the data and use it in any way. I could use it for demographics...but that sounds like too much hard work. None of this information is sold in any way.
