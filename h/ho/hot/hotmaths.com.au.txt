Cookies are small amounts of information that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser. They tell us when you have visited our site and where you have been. They do not identify you personally, just the presence of your browser.
Cookies make it easier for you to log on and use the site during future visits. They also ensure that only one person can access your account at any time.
Should you wish to do so, your browser's help section should be able to warn you before accepting cookies and how to filter or disable them, although if you do filter or disable cookies, you may not be able to use certain features on Cambridge HOTmaths.

We may occasionally provide your information to third party distributors within Australia for the purpose of managing your school subscription. The information we will provide is your first and last name, school, school address, username and password.
