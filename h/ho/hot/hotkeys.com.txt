Please note that we are not responsible for any personal information you post in public areas.

In addition to the information you provide to us by registering an account or posting content on our website, we also collect information through the use of cookies and pixel tags. We also use cookies and other technologies to gather information about your use of our website so that we may give you a personalized experience of our website and help us understand how users are using our services.
Cookies.
When you visit our website, we may send one or more "cookies" – small data files – to your computer to uniquely identify your browser to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the sites.

This Policy only applies to information collected on website or through the Hotkeys service. You may also be asked to provide personal information or permit the transfer to a third party in connection with promotions, sweepstakes or contests we host. If you are not willing to share the information with such third parties, do not participate in such promotions, sweepstakes or contests.
2. HOW WE USE, SHARE AND MAINTAIN YOUR INFORMATION
Information Uses.
We use your personal information to respond to your requests, personalize our service, administer our website, communicate with registered users, enforce our rights and the rights of third parties, and investigate and ensure compliance with our Terms of Service and applicable law. We use non-personal information (such as demographic information, anonymous usage data, IP address, web browser information, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, etc.) to help us understand how our users are using our website or services and in turn make our website and more useful to you.
Information Sharing.
We share your personal information if authorized by you or in the limited instances described below. We may be subject to liability in cases of onward transfer to third parties that do not conform with this Policy.
Third Party Services. We use outside vendors and services to help us better understand how users interact with our website, and to provide services to us or to you on our behalf. These third parties may have access to your personal information for use solely in connection with these authorized business activities.
Business Transfer. We may transfer your personal information to a third party if we or any of our affiliates are involved in a corporate restructuring (e.g., a sale, merger, or other transfer of assets).
Affiliates. We are a member of the Rightside Group, Ltd. family of companies (the “Family of Companies”). The Family of Companies includes the following U.S. based companies: Acquire This Name, Inc.; DomainSite, Inc.; eNom, Incorporated; eNom1039, Inc.; eNom1040, Inc.; eNom623, Inc.; eNom625, Inc.; Hot Media, Inc.; Mobile Name Services Incorporated; Name.com, Inc.; Name.net, Inc.; Name104, Inc.; Name105, Inc.; Name106, Inc.; Name107, Inc.; Name108, Inc.; Name109, Inc.; Name110, Inc.; Name111, Inc.; Name112, Inc.; Name113, Inc.; Name114, Inc.; Name115, Inc.; Name116, Inc.; Name117, Inc.; Name118, Inc.; Name119, Inc.; Name120, Inc.; Rightside Group, Ltd.; Rightside Operating Co.; Secure Business Services, Inc.; Sipence, Incorporated; Vedacore.com, Inc.; and Whois Privacy Protection Services, Inc.

Each U.S. based member of the Family of Companies adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles (as discussed below).
Compliance and Safety. We may disclose personal information when we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or respond to suspected illegal or fraudulent activity or to protect the safety, rights, or property of us, our users, or others. We may also disclose personal information when we believe release is appropriate in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; enforce or apply our agreements; or protect our rights, property, or safety, our users, or others.
Information Retention.
We retain information for as long as required, allowed or we believe it useful, but do not undertake retention obligations. We may dispose of information without notice, unless the law specifically requires otherwise. You must keep your own, separate back-up records. If you choose to permanently delete personal information from your account, back-up copies may exist for a short time in our databases.
Information Security.
On our side, we have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in place to help safeguard your information. However, neither people nor security systems, even encryption systems, are foolproof. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If the law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, intentional misconduct will be the standard used to measure our compliance with that duty.
On your side, YOU MUST DO WHAT YOU REASONABLY CAN TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. You should protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer and sign off when finished if you are using a shared computer. We will not ask for passwords in an email, so if you get such a request, assume it is fraudulent. We also advise you not to disclose any information in public areas of our website that you do not wish to share, as it can be viewed and possibly used by others.
