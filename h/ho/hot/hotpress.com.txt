Hotpress Privacy Policy
Introduction Your privacy is important to Hot Press and maintaining your trust is paramount to us. We are fully committed to keeping your personal information safe.
We start from the key principal, that we have asked you if we can do anything that we do, and that at any moment in time, you can remove any data that we hold on you.
There is usually a straightforward response to most queries about why we ask for information and how we use it, but to give some examples …
We ask for locations because when we have events that are near said location we went to be sure to invite you!
We ask for your age (or date of birth), because there are competitions or events that we need to restrict to certain ages.
We are interested in what artists you like so that we can inform you of specific items in relation to them.
In none of these situations do we
Pass this information to a 3rd party
Look at in an individual basis
Instead what we do is
Use global data
Contact you in an collated, anonymised way
The 2018 updates necessitated by the GDPR changes have also given rise to us starting to develop some new and innovative tools for members and subscribers, however, it will be June 2018 before we can unveil them.
This privacy policy is intended to provide you with information about the personal information we collect and how that information is used and shared. We collect personal information about you when you access this website or when you use any of our products, applications or services (collectively our “Services”).
This document outlines our approach to compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all other relevant data-protection legislation. It also sets forth your privacy rights. Please take a moment to familiarise yourself with our privacy practices.
It is important that you read this privacy policy together with any other privacy policy we may provide on specific occasions so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data. This privacy policy supplements the other notices and is not intended to override them.
We value your opinions. Should you have any questions or comments related to this privacy policy, please contact us at help@hotpress.com.

We will update this privacy policy from time to time. Some of those changes will reflect new standards, some will be merely minor technical implementations. This page will always mark the updates.
