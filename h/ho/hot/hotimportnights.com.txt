As a general policy, we use Personal Information to provide you with the Site and Services, to notify you of new products or Services, and to otherwise communicate with you. We may also share your Personal Information with third party marketing and advertising companies whom we believe are trustworthy and who have confirmed that their privacy practices are consistent with ours. These companies may collect and use information about your use of the Site or Services in order to provide you with email advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you or for direct marketing campaigns. Advertisements may be shown via the Site, the Services, or third party websites. These companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other similar technologies.
