Who We Are
Hotel News Now (“HNN”) is a division of STR, LLC, and, along with STR’s affiliate STR Global, Ltd, and STR Sector Analysis, LLC, is part of the STR Group.
HNN and the STR Group are privacy conscious organizations. This means we are committed to protecting the privacy of all individuals who interact with us, whether by registering as a subscriber to website or submitting information to us. This approach to privacy applies to all personal information received by us from our visitors and subscribers, whether in electronic, paper or verbal form. It also applies to how we use that information and the choices that are available to you regarding our use of your personal information.
Privacy Shield
The STR Group, through STR, LLC, and STR Sector Analysis, LLC, has applied to participate in and has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce, which has jurisdiction over us, that it will operate with the Department in compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework (the “Privacy Shield). STR Group has stated to the DOC that it is committed to ensuring that all personal information that is received or transferred to us from the member countries of the European Union and the European Economic Area is and will continue to be handled according to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
If you have any questions or complaints about our compliance with the Privacy Shield, please contact us at legal@str.com or send a letter to our U.S. headquarters at STR, LLC, 735 East Main Street, Hendersonville, Tennessee, USA 37075, Attention: Legal).
If we cannot resolve your complaint, or if you do not receive a timely acknowledgement of your complaint from us, you may submit the complaint at no-cost to the American Arbitration Association (AAA®) and its international division, the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (ICDR®) at http://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html.
Under certain limited circumstances, if all other remedies have been exhausted to no avail, European Union individuals may invoke binding Privacy Shield arbitration as a last resort.  Please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction for information on when you may invoke binding arbitration.   To initiate binding arbitration, you must give notification of this decision to STR at legal@str.com or send a letter to our U.S. headquarters STR, LLC, 735 East Main Street, Hendersonville, Tennessee, USA 37075, Attention: Legal).

What Information Do We Collect From You and When?
We collect personal information about you when you register to use our websites, or when someone in your organization asks that you be added as a user; when you enroll on behalf of your company in our benchmarking program; when you request more information on products or services; when you request one of STR’s executives speak to your group, company or association; when you register for, or agree to sponsor or present at our Hotel Data Conference; or when you order reports and other products from us. We will also ask for your personal information if you participate in one of our surveys or other research methods which we conduct on behalf of third-party travel and tourism companies or on our own behalf
For our HNN site, if you are merely visiting the site, but not registering or subscribing to any content, we do not collect any personal information about you. However, we may track your activity on the site using cookies, our content management system and third-party analytics sites (see more information below).
The personal information we may collect typically consists of your name, an email address, phone number and mailing address at which you wish to receive communications from us, and may include your credit card and/or banking information if you are using a personal card or account. If you are participating as a speaker in our Hotel Data Conference, in addition to the foregoing, a photograph, your curricula vitae/biography and audio/visual recordings of you may be used.
If your business or you as an individual consumer are a participant in one of our surveys or other research projects, in addition to the above information, we may ask for sensitive information such as, but not limited to, your gender preference, age, occupation, household income, post code/ZIO code, residency, or other personal information to achieve our research objectives.
Also, to ensure that our websites are well managed and to facilitate improved navigation within the sites, we or our service provider(s) use cookies (small text files stored in a user’s browser), web beacons (electronic images that allow the websites to count visitors who have accessed a particular page and to access certain cookies), or similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to collect aggregate data. Specifically, we use such Tracking Technologies to track information on our systems and identify categories of visitors by items such as IP address, domain, browser type and pages visited. These Tracking Technologies do not collect any additional personal information about you. We do not link the information collected by these Tracking Technologies to your IP address or anything that could be considered personally identifiable information.
The tracking technologies include Google Analytics for tracking on all of our websites, and Clicky and StatCounter for our Hotel News Now website. Visitors to our Tourism Consumer Insights division’s website (www.ljresearch.co.uk) will encounter a “pop-up” application provided by Tawk.to which gives those visitors the option to engage with us in real time.
You may learn more about how Google uses the information it collects by visiting the following site: “How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps” (located at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our websites is restricted by the Google Privacy Policy (located at www.google.com/policies/privacy/). Similar information about Clicky may be found at https://clicky.com and https://clicky.com/terms. StatCounter privacy and use information are found at https://statcounter.com. Tawk.to functionalities and other information may be found at https://www.tawk.to/.
Finally, we may obtain personal information about you from other sources, such as from others at your place of business (if our main contact at your company asks us to add your name and email to a list of individuals who may be granted website access or be added to a company distribution list), organizations to which you belong or are a member (usually where we are conducting surveys on behalf the organization), and public websites (to confirm office address and contact information). To the extent we combine information obtained from these sources with other information we may have collected about you, we will treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. Of course, we are not responsible for the accuracy of any information provided to us by a third party.

With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information? How Long Do We Keep it?
Your personal information may be shared between and among STR, LLC, in the United States and STR Global, Ltd, in the UK, with offices in Germany, Beijing, Dubai, Australia, Brazil, Singapore, and Spain, for purposes of enabling HNN and the rest of the STR Group to provide you with current hotel industry news, as well as the optimal data and analytic services that our customers expect.
We also contract with third party data processors to help us store, catalog and process your contact and payment/credit card information for our sales, service and marketing activities. Among these third parties are SalesForce (cloud based Customer Relations Management), Cvent (Hotel Data Conference registration), MailChimp (marketing and promotional emails), Azure (online data storage), and Proofpoint (email firewall). We require all third party data processors to keep confidential the personal information that we disclose to them and to only use such personal information for the purpose for which it was disclosed. Please let us know if you would like more information about how we work with these companies. We recognize that, under certain data privacy laws and regulations, STR Group may be liable for the actions of those agents and processors we use to process your information.
As stated above, if you are an attendee at our Hotel Data Conference, we may share your contact information with certain corporate sponsors of the Conference.
We may provide information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law or when we otherwise believe in good faith that the law requires it. There may be instances when we may access or disclose your information in order to protect or defend the legal rights or property of the STR Group or their employees and agents, to protect the safety and security of users, and to protect against fraud.
The STR Group may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets in connection with a merger, reorganization or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy, without your permission. In such an event, personal information may be one of the assets transferred.
We will not share your information with any other party, for any reason, unless otherwise disclosed at the point of collection. If that occurs, you will have the opportunity to refuse to give us consent or to withdraw your consent if previously given.
We retain your personal information for as long as needed to provide you or your company with our services. We also retain and use this information as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. If you are a participant in a survey, we retain your personal information until we have completed the project for the third party for whom the survey was conducted.
You May Access Your Information, Correct It And Delete It.
We are dedicated to providing reasonable access to visitors who wish to review the personal information we have retained so that they may correct any inaccuracies it may contain or opt to delete the information.
If you wish to see the information about you that we have in our possession, if you wish to correct this information or if you wish to have it deleted in its entirety from our systems, please email us at privacy@str.com or call 615-824-8664 extension 3340.
While we will respond to your request as quickly as possible, please allow us no more than 30 days for any personal information about you to be accessed, extracted modified and/or deleted from our servers and those of our third-party vendors.
We will certainly respect and fulfill your request to have your information removed from our system. However, please note that in certain cases (such as where you are on a distribution list or identified as the contact person for a hotel that is participating with us) such removal may result in you no longer having access to HNN news and information or to STR Group reports and data, being able to take part in ongoing research in which you may have previously indicated you wanted to participate, or hearing about new or updated STR Group products, services and events. Also, if you are the main contact for your company, or are the person identified to receive invoices on behalf of your company, we will first need for you to identify the person who will be your replacement. We will assume that you have the authority to provide us with that person’s contact information.
Also, please bear in mind that, even if we delete your information, it may still persist on back-up tapes and archival documents or electronic media on which other business critical information is stored and which STR must retain for legal, tax, or regulatory reasons, or for legitimate and lawful business purposes. Access to such archival information is limited to only authorized personnel who are under an obligation to maintain its confidentiality. ** **

How Do We Protect Your Information?
The STR Group takes appropriate administrative, physical, and technical measures (collectively “Security Measures”) to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration and destruction. We follow generally accepted standards when implementing and maintaining such Security Measures, including, but not limited to, TLS/SSL for data in transit, limiting unnecessary access, using encryption, using services such as a 24x7 Security Operations Center (SOC), monitoring for unauthorized access attempts, filtering access attempts and mitigating activities by bad actors. These Security Measures are periodically reviewed and, if necessary, updated to ensure they meet current generally accepted standards. Furthermore, only authorized personnel have access to personally identifiable information. Such employees are required to maintain the confidentiality of this sensitive data. This policy also applies to any and all agents and third party data processors that may receive such information from us. Website visitors who provide personal information to us through our websites should be aware, however, that our websites may contain links to third party sites that are not governed by this Privacy Policy or any other privacy statement.
No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of information that is transmitted to us electronically. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures we provide. If you have questions about the security of your personal information, our websites or other systems on which your personal information may be transmitted, please do not hesitate to contact us at privacy@str.com or call us at 1-615-824-8664 extension 3340.

The use of any personal information provided by you to, or automatically collected from, a third party will be governed by that party's privacy policy.
