Additionally, we collect contact information provided to us during any correspondence relating to customer support, as well as in connection with products and services offered on our Sites.

For example, when you apply to register a domain name or sign up for any other product or service through Web.com, we require you to provide a credit card number and billing address before we process that application.
Information on your use of the Site. We collect information about the device with which your use of the Sites and information on your use of the Site itself, such as the domain name, Internet Service Provider, browser type and version, pages viewed, information accessed, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address you use to connect to the Internet. We also collect information in relation to Cookies – for more information, please review our policy on cookies.
Demographic Information. We collect and store demographic information (your postcode, gender and age). We may also collect and store demographic information (such as your zip code, gender and age), and use this data to tailor your experience on our Websites, ensure you are at least 18 years of age to make purchases, provide content that we think you might be interested in, perform general improvements to the Websites, and display the content according to your preferences. Such demographic information may be shared with partners, market researchers and other third parties on an aggregate, non-personally identifiable basis. No personally identifiable information will be linked to such aggregated demographic information that is shared with third parties
Telephone Recording and Monitoring. To ensure Web.com customers receive quality service, Web.com selects phone calls for recording and/or monitoring. These calls, between Web.com customers (or potential customers) and employees, are evaluated by supervisors and/or other Web.com representatives. This is to guarantee that prompt, consistent assistance and accurate information is delivered in a professional manner.
How We Use Your Personal Data.
To perform our contract with you. We use this information to perform our contract with you and fulfil your requests, such as:
• Sending you requested service information;
• Fulfilling your order;
• Billing for services;
• Creating directories (only when you explicitly ask to be included);
• Responding to customer service requests, questions and concerns; and
• Administering your account.
Note that, generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are transactional and not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to cancel your services with us.
We also engage other companies, individuals, and affiliates of Web.com to perform certain functions and services for you. These third parties:
• process credit card payments;
• provide marketing assistance; and
• remove duplicate information from customer lists.
To contact you. If you have given your consent to send you email, phone or SMS marketing, or if you have provided us with your postal address, we will use the personal data you give to us to contact you from time to time. If you register on the Site, you can choose to provide your consent to receive marketing communications by e-mail, phone and/or cell number (including use of automated dialling equipment and/or pre-recorded calls), text (SMS) message, social networks or any other means of communication that your device may be capable of receiving (i.e. video, etc.).

Directory Listings. If you provide your information in order to be included in our free directories you are consenting to (1) individuals contacting you to solicit your products and services and (2) businesses contacting you to market services you may find useful. Due to the nature of a directory, your information will be published publicly and you may be contacted by phone or email depending on the information you provide. You will never be added to our directories unless you request to be included and you may remove your listing at any time by accessing your Scoot dashboard, calling + 44 0800 170 100 or emailing us at customersupportuk@web.com.
Promotional Offers and Sweepstakes. If you provide your name for a promotional offer or to enter a sweepstakes or contest and you win a prize, we will post a winner’s list online where your name and city will be listed for our promotional purposes and to demonstrate the transparency of a competition, and we will file your name with state agencies if required by law.
To protect our Site and our business. We monitor use of the Sites and we use the information we collect, including personal data, to pursue our legitimate interest in protecting you, others and the
Site itself by:
• identifying fraudulent activities and transactions;
• preventing abuse of the Sites and investigating and/or seeking prosecution for any potential threats to or misuse of the Sites;
• ensuring compliance with the applicable terms of service and this Privacy Policy;
• investigating violations of or enforcing these agreements; and
• otherwise protecting the rights and property of Web.com, its partners, and customers.
To improve our services. In order to pursue our legitimate interest in improving our Sites, we also use personal data to conduct research and analysis and to identify what services you and other customers like you need:
• to better understand how people interact with our websites to provide communications about products which we think will be of interest to you; and
• to determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns and advertising.
Whenever we process data for these purposes we will ensure that we always keep your personal data rights in high regard and take account of these rights. You have the right to object to this processing if you wish and if you wish to do so, please click here to update your communication preferences. Please bear in mind that if you object this may affect our ability to carry out tasks above for your benefit.
To provide required information to ICANN. For any domain name registrars owned and/or operated by Web.com, ICANN requires us to make certain information, collected in connection with the registration of a domain name, available to the public via an interactive web page and a “port 43” WHOIS service. Information made public is your full name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and, where provided, your fax number, as well as the creation and expiration dates of your domain name registration and the nameserver information associated with your domain name. This does not involve the demographic, financial or Internet usage information listed above. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy we will refer to this information collectively as your “WHOIS Information.” Please note that we do not control how members of the public may use the WHOIS Information. For the avoidance of doubt, and in order to comply with certain applicable laws or other privacy requirements, we reserve the right to mask your personally identifiable information as needed, including but not limited to, masking data published to Port 43 or the WHOIS database.
*For services in the United States, by registering on a Website and providing your telephone number, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase, inquiry and/or application for purposes of telemarketing laws. Regardless of the fact that your telephone and/or cell number may be listed with the Federal Do-Not-Call Registry or your local State Do-Not-Call list, you are providing your
express written consent to receive future information (including telemarketing) about products and services from us and/or our affiliates, and you hereby agree and consent to our contacting you using the information you have provided and will provide to us. This means we may contact you by e-mail, phone and/or cell number (including use of automated dialling equipment and/or pre- recorded calls), text (SMS) message, social networks or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving (i.e. video, etc.). We may also send you information or offers from time to time to the postal address or email address we have on file (as further outlined in this Privacy Policy).
How Long We Keep Your Personal Data.
We keep information only for as long as we need it to provide you services, manage our business or as required by law or contract. Where you have a contract with us, we will retain your data for the length of the contract, and will further retain that information for a time period consistent with our legal or regulatory responsibilities, after you terminate all your services with us to resolve disputes, enforce our relevant Service Agreement, and to adhere to the technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of the Sites.
