HotelsCombined.com Privacy Statement
Only the English version of the privacy policy is legally binding. Translations have been provided purely for user convenience. In the event of discrepancy between a translation and the English master, the English master prevails.
Our Privacy Commitment
Your privacy is important and we are committed to the protection of the personal information we collect from you.
This policy explains how we use and protect the personal information that we collect and share. Its goal is transparency and assistance to you so that you have complete confidence in the integrity of your browsing experience.
What Kind Of Information We Collect
Personal Data You Give To Us
We collect and use information which you provide to us. When you click to book, you are (as a minimum) asked for your name and email address. Depending on your booking, we may also ask for your home address, telephone number, payment information, date of birth, the names of any guests travelling with you and any preferences (such as meal preferences and any mobility restrictions).
There are also other instances where you'll provide us with information. For example:-
Communicating with our customer service team.
Opening a member account, which allows you to access exclusive member rates, save your personal settings, searches, wish-lists and manage your email subscriptions.
Participating in referral programs or other marketing campaigns, will likely require you to provide us with personal data.
Information About Others
If you make a booking for someone else through this site, you may submit that individual's personal information. However, it's your responsibility to ensure that the person or people you have provided personal data about are aware that you've done so, and have understood and accepted how we use their information (as described in this privacy statement)
Automatic Collection Of Other Information
We automatically collect some information from your computer or Device when you visit our websites or apps. This happens even if you don't make a booking. This includes your IP address, the date and time you accessed our services, the hardware, software or internet browser you use and information about your computer's operating system, and locale\language settings. We also collect information about clicks and which pages have been shown to you. When you make a booking, our system registers through which means and from which website you have made your booking.
For mobile device users, we also collect data that identifies your mobile device, device-specific settings and characteristics, application performance and other system activity.
Information From Other Sources
We may also receive information about you from other sources. These include business partners, such as affiliate partners, and other independent third parties, and anything we get from them may be combined with information provided by you. When you use some of these, you provide the booking details to our business partner, who then forward your details to us.
Hotels and their appointed third-parties may share information about you with us too. This may happen if you have support questions about your pending booking, or when disputes arise about your booking.
Payment Information
If you make a travel booking with a hotel directly, powered by the booking engine Revato, we will collect payment information from you, including your credit card number, cardholder name, expiration date, authentication code, and billing address. We will securely store (in a certified PCI-DSS environment) and transmit this information to the supplier of the travel booking to complete the transaction. Please note that the supplier processes your payment, not us. You agree to review and be bound by the supplier's policies and procedures before making a booking through this site.
Location Information And Other Information From Devices
We may collect information about your location if you have instructed your Device to send such information to the application via the privacy settings on that Device. When you use an App on a Device, we will collect and use information about you, including location information, in generally similar ways and for similar purposes as when you use this site.
You can change the privacy settings of your Device to turn off the functionality to share location information. Please note the turning of location sharing may affect certain features of our App.
