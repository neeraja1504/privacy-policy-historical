Privacy policy - hotellook
We seek to take advantage of all available means to ensure the security and transparency of the Hotellook information retrieval service (hereinafter the "Service" or "Hotellook"), which provides information about services for booking temporary accommodations. The Service Owner hereby informs users about what user information can be accessed by the Service as well as how the information that is obtained by the Service is used.
Collection and storage of information
All kinds of data are collected and processed in order to provide users with quality services in accordance with the Service Terms and Conditions of Use.
Data is stored on secure servers. Hotellook utilizes appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of data, including access control, firewalls, encryption, HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure), and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) for data transmission. Hotellook does not purposely collect information that can be used to identify (determine) specific individuals who are Service users. At the same time, Hotellook may acquire certain information about users as they use the Service and as a result of their individual actions to take advantage of Service functionality. The list of this information and the reason why it is collected are detailed below.
Information that is directly provided by users
Hotellook allows the User to subscribe to a website newsletter. The website uses the user-provided e-mail address exclusively to provide information about prices for accommodations at selected venues and to send out a newsletter. The User may at any time unsubscribe from the newsletter by clicking on the appropriate "Unsubscribe" link, which can be found in all e-mails that are sent to the user’s subscribed e-mail address.
The Hotellook software allows users to register an account on the website in order to use the Service for personal purposes. Users can log into the website Hotellook.com using social network accounts (VKontakte, Facebook, Twitter, and Odnoklassniki). In this situation the service can obtain information about the user’s name as specified in their social media account profile. This information can be used by the Service for the following purposes:
to allow the User to log into the Hotellook websites as well as other websites owned by the Service Owner, including aviasales.ru, jetradar.com, and sites that offer airline ticket sales. This is done to provide Hotellook users with special offers from Service partners;
to offer retargeting, i.e., displaying Aviasales ads to users when they visit other sites;
and to allow the user the ability to personally manage site features (i.e., the User can select and save the particular service functions and settings that they find useful).
The User is allowed to use the Service software to submit data that is required to purchase services directly on the Hotellook website or mobile app, including credit card numbers, guest names, phone numbers and e-mail addresses, and to send this information to a third party provider that sells temporary accommodation services in order to complete the booking. In this case the transmission of user data to third parties must be authorized and carried out directly by the User via a secure connection. In this case Hotellook does not receive any credit card data. However, it is able to obtain confirmation that a reservation was successfully made as well as the name and e-mail address that were specified by the user. The information that is obtained by the Service in this way is used by the Service for the following purposes:
Improving the quality of the Service,
Providing the User with support in the event of a dispute with a Service partner,
Allowing Service employees to contact the User about issues related to booking.
Automatically collected information
Hotellook automatically stores information sent by the user’s browser when they visit the site. This information includes the page request, IP address, browser type, browser language, as well as the date and time when the page was loaded. When accessing the service from a mobile device, Hotellook may collect data that identifies your mobile device as well as its specific settings and characteristics. The information that is collected in this way is used to analyze and maintain the quality of the Hotellook service.
Cookie files

to keep track of when users make reservations at Hotellook partner companies (agencies, reservation systems, hotels, inns, hostels, guest houses, etc.). After the user selects a venue that they are interested in and clicks "Book", the site redirects them to the website of the Hotellook partner where the temporary accommodations can be booked. Hotellook does not collect any personal data about users who complete a transaction on a partner site. Our service is only sent statistical data on the total number of bookings and the prices for the transactions. This information is used to determine the referral fee that is due to Hotellook;
for analysis to better target advertising.
