HOTEL INFO | Data Protection Notice
1. Anonymous use of the booking service and registration option
You can generally access our booking service without providing any personal information - it is possible to view the hotel offers anonymously. This means that you can obtain prices and view hotel descriptions without registering or logging in. However, to successfully complete a booking, your contact details are required. When you register, you will have the option to save your contact details; if you choose not to do so, your details must be re-entered for each new booking. Your contact and booking details can be viewed at any time, and you can manage your bookings, e.g. to make a cancellation. You may also amend or update your contact details at any time. Furthermore, you can store additional information, such as the invoicing address. It is still possible to make a booking without registering, but you will not be able to access the additional options described.
2. Data collection and processing when carrying out bookings
When a booking is made, the following data is collected and processed by the agent: Name, address, telephone number, email address, a different billing address if applicable, details of the reservation (hotel, location, arrival and departure time, number of nights and people travelling and the type of the booked room and price of the night) and more information is sent to the hotel if you have written messages or requests to the hotel. If you enter the name and contact information of people you are travelling with, this data is also processed. Please make sure that you have permission to use the contact information of the people you are travelling with when making an online booking. If you are booking by credit card, the credit card number, expiration date, and owner are also saved. In addition, the time of booking (date and time) and IP address from where the booking was made are also recorded.
Your information will be used to clearly organise, implement, and invoice your booking. Upon booking, a mediation contract becomes effective. The contract terms can be viewed at any time at https://www.hotel.de/About/TermsAndConditions.The booking data of registered users can be viewed at any time in the respective user's account.
All data that you provide to us as part of a successful booking is available in the form of a booking confirmation from the agent by email. Confirmations with the appropriate content are also available in all cases where you make changes to your booking or your data.
The contractual terms and all information relevant to the booking are in different languages ​​and are displayed to the user depending on their settings or used when communicating with the user. The agent uses the data referred to in paragraph 1 for carrying out the contract.
We also use your booking details (last name, first name, email address, and booking number) to invite you by email to review our website. You can always object to your data being used in this context at any time with future effect.
After your departure, you will also receive an automated request to review the visited hotel.
3. Additional data collection via app
When searching for hotels using the hotel info mobile application (app for iPhone, Android, Windows Phone etc.), you can also request search results for your current location to be displayed. To do this, you must give the provider your current location. This is only transferred when the corresponding search function is used. The information is only used to determine the most appropriate search results. Location information is not stored by the provider or used in any other way.
Anonymous usage tracking
When using the iOS app, anonymous data on the use of the app (e.g. page views, length of use) is processed and sent to the agent via special analysis tools (from Adjust, analyzer, verifier & Webtrekk). This anonymous data is used to identify general usage patterns and the needs of app users and to improve the apps accordingly. It is not linked to any specific person. If you do not agree with this anonymous data processing, you can disable this feature in the app settings.
4. Data collection and processing for applications via the application portal
When you apply online via the website’s application portal, various personal and contact details will be gathered. This includes your form of address, title, first name and last name, as well as your address, e-mail and telephone number and all attached application documents (uploads).
This data is used solely for the purpose of processing applications within hotel info. The persons responsible for the respective position and the relevant colleagues in the Human Resources department of hotel info have access to the data. Data will not be forwarded to other persons or to third parties unless you have expressly agreed to your data being forwarded.
Data is transmitted via SSL (secure socket layer) and the data is saved on hotel info systems with enhanced protection.
If your application is successful, your data will be transferred to the personnel files. Otherwise, your data will be saved for six months after the rejection/end of the application period, unless you expressly agree to an extended retention period. Your contact details and the reason for rejection will be saved in the personnel department files and this information will be used in any future applications.
5. Transfer of data to third parties
When making a booking, your name, contact details, booking and if applicable credit card details (only when booking with a credit card) and any other information you provide is sent to the hotel you are booking with.
Apart from the relevant hotel, no other third party receives any data, except in the event of a specific legal obligation. In the event of a criminal investigation, such as if it is suspected that a crime has been committed, all necessary data will be passed on to the authorities.
hotel info will not pass your details to other hotels and does not sell addresses. Respectful handling of your personal details is an integral part of the business philosophy of hotel info.
Service providers who process personal data on behalf of hotel info are contractually obliged to observe the Federal Data Protection laws and are not considered third parties under data protection legislation.
6. Use of data in prize draws
To take part in hotel info prize draws, e.g. to win a hotel stay, you must log in or register. The details stored are then used to inform you if you are a winner, and to ensure that each customer only can only enter the same competition once. Once the winner has been drawn, the prize draw partner is notified by e-mail.
The details of the winner (name, address) are sent to the relevant hotel so that the winner can be authenticated. The hotel is instructed that this data is to be used only for the purposes of redeeming the voucher and that no further use is permitted.
In individual cases we may, at the prize draw partner's request, ask whether you agree to your data being disclosed to the partner. In such cases, you have the option to consent to the disclosure of data by submitting a separate declaration.
7. Use of data for sending newsletters
If you have made a booking, the agent will use the email address you provided in this booking in order to inform you about special hotel offers, discounts or unique benefits from partner hotels in accordance with § 7 Para. 3 of the German Act against Unfair Competition (advertising own services by means of a newsletter). If you have not made a booking, you will receive this information if you have signed up with your email address to receive the newsletter.
