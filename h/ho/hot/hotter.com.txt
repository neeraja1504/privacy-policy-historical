When you place an order on the Website we obtain from you the information we need to complete your transaction and other information you share that may be useful and enhance your experience as a customer. This information may include your name, address, telephone number, email address, alternate delivery address, shoe size, date of birth, mailing preferences and information concerning your manner of payment, such as credit or debit card numbers and banking information.
If you register with Hotter USA, we will collect the information you submit on-line in connection with that process.

We may obtain information about the specific products or services you use, or your product or service preferences from your transactions and other interactions with us.
We also may sometimes obtain information from you about other people. For example, if you have an item shipped directly to a third party, we may obtain that party's name, address, telephone number and email address.
We may also collect consumer information from third-party providers to improve the accuracy of our customer database or increase our understanding of our customers. For example, we may contract with services such as the National Change of Address Service, licensed by the U.S. Postal Service, to assist us in having correct addresses for our customers.
We may combine some or all of the above information with information that we acquire about you from third parties or affiliates.

Safeguarding the Information We Collect
Protecting your personal information is important to us. Accordingly, we have appropriate and reasonable physical, technical and procedural safeguards in place to secure the personal information we collect from you. Among other security protection measures, we protect the information you provide us by:
Placing your order through an advanced secure server which encrypts all the information you input before it is sent to us.
Encrypting credit card numbers both before an order is processed and when stored on the database.

Unauthorized Charges
If unauthorized charges (as determined by your card issuer) are made on your credit or debit card as a result of purchases made on the Website utilizing our secure servers, under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your credit card provider cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of unauthorized charges on a credit card. Your liability for unauthorized use of a debit card may be higher, but many debit card issuers voluntarily apply the $50 limit to their cards as well. You need to determine for yourself whether your debit card issuer has such a policy.
It is important to remember that in the event of unauthorized use of your credit or debit card, you must promptly notify the card issuer pursuant to its reporting rules and procedures.
