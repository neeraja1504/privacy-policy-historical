WHAT INFORMATION ARE WE COLLECTING AND HOW ARE WE COLLECTING IT?
We may request your email or mailing address, credit card number and expiration date in order for you to take advantage of certain services we offer, (i.e. Backroom). We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy which means we do not intend to sell, rent or otherwise make available your email address to a third party.
Your domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, but do not collect and evaluate this information for individuals. Our Web servers do not record email addresses of the visitors unless the visitor freely submits it to us to sign up for a service.
CAN I REFRAIN FROM PROVIDING PERSONAL INFORMATION?
You may choose whether or not to provide personal information to Hot House Entertainment. If you choose not to provide the personal information we request, you can still visit most of the Hot House site but you may not be able to access certain areas of the site, offers or services that involve our interaction with you.

Cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful activities.
Identify persons who may be violating the law, the legal notice or the rights of third parties.

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, for example through email, discussion lists or elsewhere, that information can be collected and used by others.

Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your information. Use caution and be responsible whenever you are online.
