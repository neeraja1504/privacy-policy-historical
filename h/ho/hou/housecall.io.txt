HouseCall - Privacy Policy
This privacy policy was last modified on October 1, 2013.
Welcome to HouseCall, an online and mobile service from Codefied, Inc. (“HouseCall,” “we,” or “us”). Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service, and your choices about the collection and use of your information.
HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION
Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Use.
We collect the following types of information about you:
Information you provide us directly as a Consumer
We ask for certain information such as your first and last name, home address, phone number, email address, photograph of yourself, or if you correspond with us. You may also provide us with photographs related to your use of the Service. You will need to provide your financial information for purposes of processing a transaction on or through the Service. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service such as Pro ratings and comments. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, as is further described below.
Information you provide us directly as a Pro
If you create a Pro account with HouseCall, you have the opportunity to provide additional information (“Business Profile”) such as your business name, logo, photograph of yourself, credentials and qualifications, licenses, year of business establishment, as well as links to your personal web site, if you have one. You will need to provide your financial information for purposes of processing a transaction on or through the Service. You may also have the ability to upload a photograph portfolio of your previous work. We may supplement or modify the Business Profile to conform to our editorial policies or to add information from your website, materials that you supply to us, or publicly available sources. When you respond to a Consumer’s Service Request, any or all of the Business Profile can be displayed to the Consumer making such Service Request. We may also conduct a background check on you and/or your business.
Inviting a friend to use HouseCall from the “Invite friends” or “Pro referral” feature
If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service through our “Invite friends” feature, you may directly choose a friend to invite through your mobile device’s native contact list – but we do not require that you import your contacts list to the Service, and we do not retain the information contained in your contacts list. You understand that by inviting a friend to HouseCall through the “Invite friends” feature, you are directly sending a an SMS text message or an email from your personal accounts and that we are not storing your contact list. In addition, you understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications sent from your phone. Since this invitation is coming directly from your email or phone, we do not have access to or control this communication. If you choose to use our “Pro referral” feature, we will ask you to provide us with certain personal information for a third party so that we can invite them to join the Service, including their first and last name, and email address and phone number. We may retain this information for the purposes of inviting the third party to join the Service and to track the success of the referral feature. Unless the invitee agrees to join the Service, we do not use the invitee’s contact information for marketing purposes, and we do not share such information with third parties. The invitee may contact us at any time to request that we remove his or her information from our records at support [at] tryhousecall [dot] com.
Use of Facebook Connect
We may allow you to login to our Service with Facebook Connect. When you do so, we collect your Facebook graph information including the people you are friends with on Facebook.
Analytics information
We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.
Cookies
When you visit the Service online, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets HouseCall help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
Clear gifs/web beacons information
When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information is allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
Device identifiers
When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smartphones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier (“UUID”). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by HouseCall. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
Location data
When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.
Commercial and marketing communications
We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt-out or change your preferences.
