Information That We Collect and How We Use It
When you register for the site or sign up for membership, we may collect name, address, and email address, unique identifiers such as your user ID and password, your credit card number, and some demographic information (zip code, age, income level).
When you order a product or service, we may collect name, mailing address, email address, and credit card number. This allows us to notify you of your order status, to address any issues with your order, and to process and fulfill your order.

When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.
At various times, we may ask you to volunteer other information about your interests, preferences, etc. Your input is used to help us make the information we provide you more relevant and useful.
We personalize your experience by presenting offers that might be of interest and by presenting content that best matches your interests. We also monitor site traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the site.
