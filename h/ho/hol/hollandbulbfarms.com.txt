| Privacy Policy  |
---|---
At HollandBulbFarms.com, we are committed to providing our customers with high quality products. So that our customers can feel as confident and secure about shopping on line as they do with our products generally, we have developed the following policy to explain our dedication to the customer's privacy and to ensure that customers have easy access to information about our data collection and dissemination practices.
Customer Information We Collect On Line
When you visit HollandBulbFarms.com, our web server will automatically recognize your domain name, but will not gain automatic access to any other individually identifying customer information, including your e-mail address. With the exception of this single automatic process, the only information we collect about you is that which you volunteer either when requesting a catalog or at the check-out screen when you are ordering our products. On each of these screens, you have the opportunity to provide us with your personal contact information (i.e., name, address, e-mail). Additionally, when you place an order with us, you may volunteer your credit card billing information and e-mail address, so that we may process your order and timely notify you of its status.
How We Protect Customer Information
When you volunteer personal information on our web site, all such information is encrypted before it is sent to our server. We utilize SSL (Secure Socket Layering) to encrypt your information when transferring it to our server. Additionally, we maintain appropriate safeguards internally to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of your personal information within our company We provide a Safe & Secure shopping experience to guarantee that the information you provide us stays with us, and no one else.
