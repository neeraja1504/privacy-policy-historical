In order to contact you about services and offers that are relevant to you, we may analyse your browsing and purchasing activity, both on-line, via our customer contact centre or in our centres as well as your responses to our marketing communications. We may use software and other automated technology to help us to do this analysis.
Online advertising
If you visit our websites, you may subsequently see banner advertisements from us whilst browsing other websites. These advertisements are provided by HBG via specialist media providers using ‘cookies’ placed on your computer or other devices. Please see our cookie policy for further information.
Sharing data with third parties
In order to provide our services, securely fulfil transactions and provide you relevant marketing communications, we may need to share your personally identifiable data or anonymised data with selected partners including payment processing companies, IT service providers (such as hosting companies), analytics companies and marketing services agencies.
HBG only allows its service partners to handle your personal data when they conform to the appropriate data protection and security controls.

How long do we keep your data?
We will not retain your data for longer than necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy. In general, we will keep your data for the duration of our relationship with you and for a certain period afterwards. In considering how long to keep it, we take into account the nature of the information, the nature of the relationship with you, the relevance of the information, and our obligations to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The longest we hold any personally identifiable data is 4 years after your last order, interaction with our marketing communications, contact with our customer contact centre or visit to one of our centres. After that time, we anonymise any transactional data that we hold for the purposes of accounting records or business analysis.

Extra EEA Transfers
If you are based within the EEA, please note that we may transfer personal information to countries outside the EEA. Not all countries provide the same level of protection in relation to personal information as within the EEA. Where necessary to make such transfers, we will comply with our legal and regulatory obligations in relation to the personal information. This will include having a lawful basis for transferring personal information and putting appropriate safeguards in place to ensure an adequate level of protection for the personal information.
Our legal basis for processing personal data
We process customer data on a carefully considered and specific legal basis. This basis may be where you have given your consent; or for the performance of a contract; or where necessary to comply with a legal obligation; or where necessary to protect the safety or other vital interests of an individual; or where it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of HBG or another party. Examples of the “Legitimate interests” of HBG, include the interests of HBG in conducting and managing our business to enable us to provide the best experience to our customers including:
