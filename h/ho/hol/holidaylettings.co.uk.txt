Marketing
We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related opportunities on our Website. One way we do this is by sending you emails that contain information about your travel-related interests. We believe these emails will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our sites
You will receive marketing messages from us if you have given your consent, if you have requested them or if you purchased services from us and you have not opted out of receiving marketing messages.
Each time you receive an email of this type, you will be able to tell us if you no longer wish to receive them, or deny push notifications in the application, or change the settings of your mobile device to do so. You will be able to unsubscribe from marketing communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link that you will find at the bottom of each communication you receive from us.
Please note that we may continue to send you service communications, such as administrative messages about your account or transactional messages related to one of your bookings or your Holiday Lettings account. It is not possible to unsubscribe from these service communications.

If we sell or divest our business or any part of it, and your personal data relates to such sold or divested part of our business, or if we merge with another business, we will share your personal data with the new owner of the business or our merger partner, respectively. If we are legally obliged to do so, we will share personal data to protect our customers, the site, as well as our company and our rights and property.

To the extent that our parent company and corporate affiliates have access to your personal data, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy. They also will comply with applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications and, at a minimum, give you an opportunity in any commercial email they send to choose not to receive such email messages in the future.
We may also share your information if we believe, in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary:
