If you provide us with personal information, we may retain and use that information for several purposes. For example, we may use your personal information in order to provide information and services that you request such as responding to questions and sending emails to our email list subscribers. In addition, we may use your personal information to ensure compliance with Touchstorm’s policies and applicable law. In order to offer you a more consistent experience in your interactions with the Site, information collected via the Site may be combined with information we collect by other means. We may also use your personal information to improve the Site, or to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the Site to your particular preference or interests. If you have chosen to receive communications by email from us but later wish to opt out of receiving such communications from us at any time, simply follow the instructions for doing so included in the emails. We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Site, such as service announcements or similar administrative or transactional messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.
3.2 Disclosure Regarding Service Providers
Touchstorm contracts with other companies to provide services on our behalf, such as hosting websites, sending out information, and analyzing the Site. We provide these companies with only those elements of your personal information they need to deliver those services. These companies and their employees are prohibited from using that personal information for any other purpose.
3.3 Disclosures In Connection With Acquisitions Or Divestitures
Circumstances may arise where for strategic or other business reasons Touchstorm decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize its own or other businesses. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal and other information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers. It is Touchstorm’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions. In the event that Touchstorm or all of its assets are acquired in such a transaction, customer information would be one of the transferred assets.
3.4 Disclosure For Other Reasons
We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal requirements or with legal process served on us, to protect and defend our rights or property, or in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of any individual.

5.2.2 Marketing Information: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences unless you specifically ask us to delete such information.
