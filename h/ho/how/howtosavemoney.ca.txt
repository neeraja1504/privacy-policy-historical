Privacy Policy | HowToSaveMoney.ca
Everything you're about to read below is just the long way of saying we care about your privacy and we won't share your personal information with anyone without your consent. Any personal information you give us, like your email address, will only be used to keep in touch with you or to carry out the exact thing you gave it us for, like participating in a contest for instance.
This site does generate some financial income and occasional other perks through advertising and by recommending products we believe in. However, only an extremely small percentage of our content generates any income whatsoever, except through clearly marked ads you will see on the page, like Google Adsense. We always give our honest opinion of any product we are discussing regardless if there is money involved or not.
All information you read on this site is our opinion only. We do our best to ensure it is factual but mistakes are made and information does become stale over time. We are not financial professionals and suggest you consult a professional before making any decisions that could impact you financially.
