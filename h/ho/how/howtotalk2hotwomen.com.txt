INFORMATION COMPANY COLLECTS AND HOW COMPANY USES IT
Personally Identifiable Information: We may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally (such as your name, address, e-mail address and telephone number) when you register with us or at other times, such as when you buy products or services, if you choose to subscribe to a web forum or blog, or if you choose to participate in a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion. In addition, we may ask that you provide us with demographic information, information regarding your interests, or similar information when you submit a registration form on the Web Site. Providing us with information about yourself is voluntary, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Web Site's features and services.
The Web Site may also receive information about you from other sources, such as in connection with a promotion the Web Site is participating in that is offered on a third-party web site, and we may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information that we collect through this Web Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personally identifiable information received.
Mehow may use your personally identifiable information to provide you with requested information or services, to contact you in connection with a promotion, or for other purposes disclosed when you provide your information. We may use your information for internal business purposes, such as to improve the Web Site and our business strategies, or to serve specific content or advertisements to you. If you choose to receive information from the Web Site, we may contact you with information regarding one of our products or that of an affiliate or business partner. We may also contact you regarding any problems or questions we have relating to your use of the Web Site, or, in our discretion, notify you of changes to our Privacy Policy, Terms of Use or other policy or terms that affect you or your use of the Web Site
If you submit to the Web Site a comment, photograph or other content to be published, online or offline (including on-air, in a DVD, or any other format), we may publish your name or other personally identifiable information in connection with publishing the content.
If you provide us with personally identifiable information of a friend, or your friend provides personally identifiable information about you, to e-mail a feature from the Web Site, the e-mail addresses you or your friend supply us for those activities will not be used to send you or your friend other e-mail communications unless disclosed at the time you provide the information.
Please note that information submitted to the Web Site via a "contact us," "help" or other similar e-mail address or form will not necessarily receive a response. We will not use the information provided to these e-mail addresses or forms for marketing purposes unrelated to your request.
Note To Parents About Children: This Web Site is not directed to persons younger than 18, and does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from persons younger than 18. If you are younger than 18, do not send any information about yourself to the Web Site. If Mehow discovers that a person younger than 18 has provided the Web Site with personally identifiable information, Mehow will delete that person's personally identifiable information.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information: When you visit or download information from this Web Site, our web servers may automatically collect web site usage information. Web site usage information is non-personally identifying information that describes how our visitors use the Web Site. It can include the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length of their stays, browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting the Web Site, and IP addresses (see below for more information on IP addresses). We also may determine your screen resolution and the technology available in order to serve you the most appropriate version of a web page, e-mail or similar service.
Use Of IP Addresses: An internet protocol or IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer or network when you are on the internet. When you request pages from this Web Site, our servers may log your IP address. Mehow may use IP addresses for a number of purposes, such as system administration, to generally determine your computer's server location, to report aggregate information to our business partners or to audit use of the Web Site.
Use of Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies: This Web Site's pages or e-mail messages may contain cookies, web beacons (also known as clear gifs), or similar technologies as they become available. Cookies are information files that this Web Site may place on your computer to provide extended functionality. We may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as tracking usage patterns on the Web Site, measuring the effectiveness of advertising, limiting multiple responses and registrations, facilitating your ability to navigate the Web Site and as part of a verification or screening process. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent by indicating this in the preferences or options menu in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of this Web Site will not operate correctly if you disable cookies and you may not be able to take advantage of some of this Web Site's features. You should consult with your browser's provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding disabling cookies.
A web beacon is a small graphic image that allows the party that set the web beacon to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of the web page, web-based document or e-mail message, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can be very small and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail, including HTML based content, can act as a web beacon. Mehow may use web beacons to count visitors to the web pages on the Web Site or to monitor how our users navigate the Web Site, and we may include web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many messages sent were actually opened, acted upon or forwarded.
Our web pages may include advertisements for third parties and their products, and those third-party advertisements may include a cookie or web beacon served by the third party. Mehow does not have control over the cookies or web beacons used by third parties and does not have access to whatever information they may collect.
