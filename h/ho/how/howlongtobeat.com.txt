How long does it take to beat your favorite games? - HowLongToBeat.com
TLDR/Creator Comment: HLTB is developed and operated by a single person (with help from my beloved forum mod Pongsifu). I have no interest in abusing or selling your personal data. All information collected is willingly provided by you and used as minimally as possible for HowLongToBeat.com's functionality. I even encrypt your email address in case of a database breach. I respect your time and will always strive for transparency. I consider it an absolute privilege and pleasure to provide this service for you. HLTB is a passion project but websites do cost money to run and ads are used to keep the servers online and provide a small amount of compensation for my time. Thank you for visiting. - Everdred (Randy)
