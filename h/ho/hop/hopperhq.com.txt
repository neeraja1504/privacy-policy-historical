What information we collect about you
Our primary goals in collecting personally identifiable information are to provide you with the product and services made available through the Site, including, but not limited, to the Service, to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account, if you have one.
Site visitors:
When someone visits www.hopperhq.com we use third party services, Google Analytics & Mixpanel, to collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site and how those visitors arrived at the site. This information is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone. We do not make, and do not allow Google to make, any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website. If we do want to collect personally identifiable information through our website, we will be up front about this. We will make it clear when we collect personal information and will explain what we intend to do with it.

If you desire to use the Hopper HQ web and mobile tools ( e.g. app.hopperhq.com) and want access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to Hopper HQ.
