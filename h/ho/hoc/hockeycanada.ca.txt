Background
Hockey Canada is the sole governing body for amateur hockey in Canada. In co-operation with thirteen Branch associations, the Canadian Hockey League and Canadian Inter-University Sport, Hockey Canada operates Hockey Programming across Canada. Hockey Programming means making all arrangements for amateur hockey leagues, teams and games including choosing and training coaches and referees, deciding which players may participate at which level, establishing appropriate rules and regulations for amateur hockey. As part of their Hockey Programming activities, Hockey Canada and its aforementioned partners also take responsibility for determining if transfer regulations may apply, scouting, gauging the success of certain programs in order that might improve upon them, facilitating emergency contact, providing educational opportunities, career opportunities, research and to maintaining regular electronic updates/contact with participants.
Purpose of this Policy
Hockey Canada has developed this Privacy Policy for implementation beginning January 1, 2004. This Policy describes the way that Hockey Canada collects, uses, retains, safeguards, discloses and disposes of the personal information of prospective members, members, and others including players, coaches, referees, managers and volunteers.
This Policy describes the way that Hockey Canada will, subject to applicable legal requirements, adhere to all relevant federal and provincial legislative privacy requirements. The Policy follows the 10 Canadian Standards Association (CSA) principles identified in the federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). The Policy describes each principle and the method of implementing each. Hockey Canada will strive to meet or exceed federal and provincial legislative requirements and will ensure that it remains current with changing technologies and laws. Any and all changes will immediately be posted to the Hockey Canada web site.
