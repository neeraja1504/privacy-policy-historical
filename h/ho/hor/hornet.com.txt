Any personal information processed by Hornet in connection with this Privacy Policy is controlled by Hornet Networks Limited, which is considered the data controller of your personal information under relevant data protection laws.
WHAT DO WE MEAN BY PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Personal information means details which identify you or could be used to identify you, such as your name and contact details, age, profile, comments, photographs, geographic locations, ethnic background, preference data and more.  It may also include information about how you use our websites and mobile applications.
WHEN DOES THIS POLICY APPLY?
This Privacy Policy applies to personal information about you that we collect, use and otherwise process regarding your relationship with us as a customer or potential customer, including when you engage with us or use our other products or services, use our websites or mobile applications or contact us.
HOW CAN YOU KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE?
We take great care to protect the personal information you provide to us. Here are some things that you can do to keep your information secure.
KEEP YOUR HORNET REGISTERED CUSTOMER LOG-IN DETAILS CONFIDENTIAL
To make sure your access to our websites and mobile applications is secure, you should not share your log-in details with anyone else.  When you finish using the website or mobile app you should log out if others may be able to access your computer or device. This is especially important if you are using a publicly accessible computer.
BE AWARE OF AND PROTECT YOURSELF AGAINST INTERNET FRAUD AND PHISHING
There is an internet fraud practice known as phishing which is the illegal gathering of personal information by deception. Unsolicited emails are sent to individuals from lists illegally gathered by a third party, and recipients are asked to enter login, password or other personal details into a cloned or illegal copy website. You should ensure that you always have up-to-date protection software on your devices to minimise the risks of becoming the target of an attack.
We will never ask you to disclose your password to any of our staff. If you receive a suspicious request purporting to be from us, do not take any actions before confirming the authenticity of the request with us directly, using the contact details provided in this policy.

For users joining our community who are subject to the data protection legislation of the EU, we will specifically ask them whether they wish to receive our newsletters. All other new users will automatically benefit from our newsletters, and all users can unsubscribe from our newsletters at any time. Please be aware that we do sometimes send marketing communications that promote a third party’s products and services (for example, those of our business partners) as well as our own.
We may ask if you consent to receiving marketing communications from other members of our group or from third parties.
We will respect your choice as to what communications you wish to receive and the methods by which you are sent them.
HOW CAN YOU CHANGE WHAT MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS YOU RECEIVE AND HOW YOU RECEIVE THEM?
If you decide you would no longer like to be sent marketing communications, you can change your mind at any time.

If you ask us to stop sending marketing communications, please note we will retain your personal information for the purposes of indicating that you do not want to receive marketing communications.
WHAT IS OUR LEGAL BASIS FOR USING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Hornet will only process your personal information where we have a legal basis to do so. The legal basis will depend on the reason or reasons Hornet collected and needs to use your information. Under most relevant laws (EU, UK and others) in almost all cases the legal basis will be:
Because we need to use your information so that we can provide the products and services to you and otherwise perform the contract we have with you.
Because it is in Hornet’s legitimate interests to use your personal information to operate and improve our business.
Because Hornet needs to use your personal information to comply with a legal obligation.
To protect the vital interests of you or another person.
Because you have consented to Hornet using your information for a particular purpose.
If processing of your data is subject to any other laws then the basis of processing your data may be different to that set out above and may in those circumstances be based on your consent in all cases.
WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH?
Your personal information may be shared with companies within our group to assist us in providing the services to you.  We may also disclose your personal information to the following third parties for the purposes described here:
Credit and charge card companies and anti-fraud screening service providers to process payments and (where necessary) to carry out fraud-screening.
In response to a valid legal request from Government, regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies.
Third parties such as law firms and law courts to enforce or apply any contract with you or including subpoenas, court orders, legal process.
In order to improve our business services, we may share information about your age and location, as well as non-personally identifiable information, with our advertising and analytics providers and with related service providers.
We may share your personal data with any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control. If another company acquires our company, business, or our assets, that company will possess the personal data collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy.
HOW LONG WILL WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We will keep your personal information for as long as is necessary to provide you with our services and as permitted by the relevant legal requirements.
When you delete your account, it will be removed from our active database, but in some circumstances, it may remain in certain archives where it is not practical or possible to delete it.
In addition, we may keep your personal data and usage history (which includes a history of text or photos that have been censored, banned) as needed to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and/or enforce any of our agreements.
WHAT COUNTRIES WILL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION BE SENT TO?
Your personal information may be sent to and stored by us and third parties in countries outside the country in which you are located and outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK).
The nature of our business means it is often necessary for us to send your personal information outside the EEA or the UK to fulfil your use of our products and services. This occurs because our business and the third parties identified in ’Who do we share your personal information with?’ have operations in countries across the world. For example, you may be based in the European Economic Area or UK, your personal information will be transferred to other Hornet members outside of those territories.
In addition, we may transfer your data to parties in countries outside the country in which you are located to provide services to us.
This may involve sending your data to countries where under their local laws you may have fewer legal rights.
REQUESTING A COPY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Under the relevant data protection laws, you may request a copy of any personal data about you held by Hornet Networks Limited. In most instances, this is provided free of charge.
You can request your personal data from the mobile app or website.
We will need to verify your identity in order to request your data and we prefer to send your data to you by email.
If you no longer can access your account, our support team (feedback@hornet.com) can help you find your account details so you can login again.
If you have deleted your account, we no longer hold your personal information, subject to certain conditions set out above in the section “How long will we keep your personal information?”.
WHAT ARE YOUR OTHER RIGHTS IN RELATION TO THE PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT?
Dependent on the jurisdiction you are subject to, you may have some additional rights in relation to your personal information. Should you be subject to EU data protection legislation, for instance, you have, under certain circumstances, a right to:
Access your personal data, rectify inaccurate data or erase your personal data, as well as request a restrictiction of or object to the processing of your personal data. Your profile can be amended by you at any time, allowing you to update your personal data as necessary;
Withdraw your consent at any time where consent forms the legal basis of the data being processed. Note that a withdrawal of consent may impact the services we will be able to offer to you; and
Get in touch with your relevant data protection authority to file a complaint. For a list of EU data protection authorities please see: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm.
In order to make our services more relevant to you and to improve our overall services, we may use automated processing of some of your personal information. We may use such automated processing in the following  instances:
In relation to your interactions with other users and certain content on the Hornet platform (such as who you communicate with, which profiles you have viewed and/or follow, contents of your profile, which content you and other users liked or similar activities) to suggest other users you may wish to talk to and vice versa (our “HornetSuggest” feature); and
To allow us to moderate the large number of images submitted to us, our dedicated software automatically analyses and categorizes such images. If any of your images are not accepted or you have any queries in relation to our categorisation of images, please contact us using the contact details in this policy.
PERSONAL INFORMATION OF CHILDREN
