Information Collection and Use
The Horse Collaborative and the users posting information to this website are the sole owners of the information posted to or collected on this site. Any and all Horse Collaborative registered user or customer contact information, including but not limited to e-mail addresses, phone numbers, or mailing addresses provided on the Horse Collaborative site, is only for use by persons or entities interested in buying the particular horse, product or service offered by the customer. Unless arranged through Horse Collaborative as an approved and bonafide special promotion, Horse Collaborative’s registered users or its customers’ contact information may not be used or provided by anyone in the sale, promotion or solicitation of their business, products or services. Any violation of this policy shall be considered theft of information belonging to the Horse Collaborative and its users.
We, the Horse Collaborative collect information from you, our users, at several different points on our website. However, we won’t intentionally share, lease or sell any of your personally identifiable information with third parties for marketing purposes.

Please note that the user’s email address and contact phone number will be displayed to our users.
Order
We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and billing address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used to collect any amounts, fees or subscription charges that a user may owe us for their use of our website or for posting a classified advertisement to our website.

Cookies
We use cookies and other technologies to collect demographic information, personalize your experience on our site and other activities. Cookies are small files downloaded to your computer to track movements within web sites. For example, we use “cookies” or other methods to monitor website usage. We may link cookie information to personal information. Some of our business partners also use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.
Web Beacons
To help us (and in some cases our advertisers) keep track of how many users are accessing particular pages and listings within our website, and to track how users respond to ads we place on third-party websites, we may place a small file, called a web beacon, on some of our pages and on some of the listings we distribute. In combination with cookies, these web beacons allow us (or our advertisers) to track the number of users who view particular pages and listings to fine tune the advertising messages delivered to users of this and other websites. We may use “clickstream” data collected using web beacons and cookies to help us tailor the content of promotional messages, including email messages, to the perceived interests of our users. Advertising networks with which we are affiliated and third-party advertising services that we use may also use web beacons on our site to gather similar anonymous “clickstream” information, which is used to fine tune advertising messages delivered to our visitors and visitors to other websites.
Browser Level Information
Our web server automatically collects limited information about your computer configuration when you visit our site, including the type of browser software you use, the operating system you’re running, the resolution of your computer monitor, the website that referred you, and your IP address.
