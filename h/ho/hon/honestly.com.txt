Use of cookies
We use cookies on our website. These small text files are stored on the browser of your PC on request. They help us to customize the content and the format of our website to your needs for the future. We do not use cookies to place damaging programs or spyware onto your computer. You can also use our website without the use of cookies, which may limit or affect some presentations and features of our offer. If you wish to deactivate the cookies, you can do this through special settings for your browser. Please use help functions to make the appropriate changes. You can manage online advertisement cookies through the following links: http://www.aboutads.info/choices for the USA and http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices  for Europe.
Of course, if you have activated the Do-Not-Track function on your browser, we will not store any data. However, with your permission to place cookies, you help us to continuously improve our website and our offer.
SSL encryption
Our website uses SSL encryption when it comes to the transmission of all data and content of our users. This encryption is activated, for example, in the processing of payments and requests that you make to us through our website. Please make sure that the SSL encryption is activated on your side during activities. The use of encryption is easy to recognize: The display in your browser line changes from "http: //" to "https: //". SSL-encrypted data cannot be read by third parties. Only submit your confidential information when SSL encryption is activated and contact us in case of doubt.
Google Analytics
We use the web analytics service Google Analytics from Google Inc. on our website, which uses cookies. These text files allow an analysis of your user behaviour regarding our website. The cookies generate information that is transmitted to a Google server. These servers are typically located in the USA, but they are based on usage agreements with the European Economic Area and truncate your IP address before it is sent to the USA. Only in exceptional cases is the IP address truncated after transfer to the USA. Google evaluates the information and provides other services in this context for us as website operators. The IP address is not combined with other Google services. By changing your browser settings, you can prevent the storage of cookies on your computer; however, this may be associated with display and functional restrictions when using our website. A browser plugin also prevents the collection and use of the data generated by the cookies. You can download it underthe following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de

Google AdWords
With Google AdWords, we use an online advertising program provided by Google Inc. on our website. This also includes conversion tracking. With this tool, Google AdWords places a cookie on your PC if you visit our website through a Google ad. The cookie is invalid after 30 days. It has no personal traceability. If you visit our website as a user and the cookie is still working, we, together with Google, become aware that you have clicked on the corresponding advertisement and have been redirected to our website. Each Google AdWords customer is assigned a different cookie. Cookies are thus not traceable via the websites of the advertisers. Data gathered through conversion cookies are used to generate conversion statistics for advertisers. We, as customers, find out the total number of users who engaged with our advertisement and were then diverted to a web page that was tagged with a conversion tracking tag. We do not receive any information in this process that could personally identify you as a user. If you object to the tracking process, you can deactivate the cookie of the Google conversion tracking system on your browser. If you need to, use the help function of the browser for further information. For more information about Google's privacy policy, please visit http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.

For companies, their employees and customers
General Information
Feedback terminals and web feedback form
Our terminals serve for the easy collection of feedback. Personal data are collected if you provide them in the feedback form. Filling in these data is voluntary. If, for example, you provide a mobile phone number or e-mail address, this will be used by our customers to contact you. This is for the purpose of providing more details about your feedback to better meet your needs. The precise purpose of the data collection is specified in the respective contact form.
If you order an Honestly terminal, your data will be forwarded to the freight company commissioned with the delivery, insofar as this is necessary for the delivery of the goods. To process payments, we pass on your payment data to the bank responsible for the payment.
If you voluntarily enter your contact data into a feedback form, you consent to Honestly forwarding this information to the company to which you have provided feedback.
Manager app
No personal data are collected via our Manager app. Only the results of the collected feedback are shown. To log into your Manager app account, you need your e-mail address and the password of your web account.
Deletion of personal data
Upon complete processing of the contract and full payment of the purchase price, your data will be blocked for further use and deleted after expiry of the tax and commercial retention periods, unless you have deliberately consented to the further use of your data.
Data security
After you have logged into our website with your access data, into our app or with a terminal, you can access the collected data. Communication and transmission of data via our server is always encrypted. Particularly all payment data is encrypted between you and us. Please note that access by third parties cannot be excluded to one hundred per cent. For your own safety, we recommend that you log out before leaving the website and close the browser window. Please also ensure that no third parties are aware of your login credentials.
Employee Engagement
Honestly always enters into a data processing agreement (DPA) with participating companies to ensure that both parties securely handle employee feedback. Feedback from company employees is encrypted and transmitted to our servers and made available to the company. Honestly ensures that companies can no longer link this feedback with individual employees.
Personal data provided to us by participating companies
To participate as an active user in Honestly surveys, the company provides a list of employee names and e-mail addresses to Honestly. Optionally, additional metadata such as department, gender, or location are provided. Through this information, the employees are registered into the feedback system as users. The data are only used to send surveys to employees to ensure that each user only participates in each survey once, and to allow analysis of the collected metadata. The collected data are processed internally for analysis purposes. Employee data of our customers are never passed on to third parties by Honestly.
Engage app
With the Honestly Engage app, companies can easily conduct continuous pulse surveys and/or one-time surveys among their employees. This feedback can be evaluated in real-time via the Honestly Manager app and the Honestly web application.
The Engage app can be downloaded from the Google Play Store or the Apple Store. To log into the network of your own company, users must previously have been entered (as described above) into the system. Then, by logging in once, they can easily take part in surveys with their company e-mail via their smartphone. Feedback via mobile phones will not save any other personal data. We do not access any other services on your private device. If you voluntarily enter personal information into a feedback form, you consent to Honestly passing this information on to the company to which you provided feedback.
The Engage App's anonymized usage data and error logs are sent to Fabric.io (belonging to Google LLC) on a regular basis to continually improve the app and identify and fix potential errors. Employee data or feedback data from the employees are not transferred.
For more information about the privacy policy of Fabric.io, see:
https://docs.fabric.io/apple/fabric/data-privacy.html
Address: Google LLC. Headquarters: 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043
By submitting feedback through the engage app, feedback terminal, or through our web feedback form (e-mail link), you consent to Honestly anonymously collecting, storing, and forwarding your feedback to your company.
Customer experience
Customer surveys are usually anonymous. Every customer can take part in surveys via the terminal or link. Data is only collected if the customer voluntarily enters them into the feedback form (for example, to contact them).
If you voluntarily enter your contact data into a feedback form, you consent to Honestly forwarding this information to the company to which you have provided feedback.
