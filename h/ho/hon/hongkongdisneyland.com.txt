Privacy Policy for Hongkong International Theme Parks Limited and Hong Kong Disneyland Management Limited
This Privacy Policy has been revised.
Effective Date: November 6, 2018
This Privacy Policy is designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy practices and principles. In keeping with the traditions of The Walt Disney Company, we refer to our customers as “guests”. When this Privacy Policy uses the term “personally identifiable information”, we mean information that identifies a particular individual. When other information, such as consumer product preferences or number of children, is directly associated with personally identifiable information, this other information also becomes personally identifiable information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. Personally identifiable information is sometimes referred to in this Privacy Policy as “personal information”. Finally, the terms of this Privacy Policy are subject to, and shall be interpreted according to, the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.
As used in this Privacy Policy, “The Walt Disney Family of Companies” refers to The Walt Disney Company and its subsidiary and affiliated entities, singly or together, including companies such as ABC and ESPN that generally do not offer their products and services under the “Disney” brand name, as well as companies that generally do offer their products and services under the “Disney” brand name. Hongkong International Theme Parks Limited and Hong Kong Disneyland Management Limited are members of The Walt Disney Family of Companies, and are referred to in this Privacy Policy as “we”, “us”, “our”, and “ourselves”.
Scope of Privacy Policy
1. What information does this Privacy Policy cover?
This Privacy Policy applies to all personally identifiable information that we obtain from (i) individuals who are themselves the subject of such information; (ii) other members of The Walt Disney Family of Companies; (iii) third parties regarding individuals who have expressed an interest in our products and services and (iv) third parties who provide goods and services to us. This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information obtained by us for recruitment or employment-related purposes.
Information We Collect
2. What types of personal information may we collect?
We may collect various types of personal information. For example, we may receive personal information that comes directly from guests who are interested in obtaining various products and services from us. Such information may include, for example, the guest's name, postal address, e-mail address and telephone number. For verification purposes, each time before you enter Hong Kong Disneyland, we may take a photo of you at the turnstile, or if you do not wish to have your photo taken, we will offer you an alternative method of verification (e.g. presenting a particular proof of identity as we may specify from time to time). We also may collect other types of information such as gender, age, number of children, and personal interests, which we may associate with personal information. If you purchase products or services from us, we may note, for example, credit card or other charge card information, the type of services or products ordered or purchased, and the date of the order or purchase. In addition, we may collect personal information from you if you participate in sweepstakes, contests, games or promotional offers. If you receive our care services, such as medical attention, it may be necessary to collect information about your condition and medical history to administer that care or to assess your circumstances. When you request for our goods or services or send us enquiries, we may collect your contact information and details of your request or enquiry in order to respond to you. The provision of your personal information is voluntary. However if you do not provide sufficient information, we may not be able to provide assistance to you.
3. How may we use your personal information that we collect?
We may use and share your personal information with the transferees set out in this Privacy Policy for the following purposes:
to process your requests or enquiries;
to process and complete transactions requested by you;
designing new or enhancing existing services provided by us for guests' use;
for promotional or marketing purposes (only if consent is obtained from you), including (i) sending you promotional materials and conducting direct marketing in relation to our products and services, either alone or in conjunction with products/services offered by our affiliates or business partners and (ii) publishing your personal information in marketing or promotional materials of our products and services in any media and format. Written consent will be obtained from you if we share your personal information with another party (including our subsidiaries and affiliates) for their use for promotional or marketing purposes;
to send you administrative communications, such as information about any account you may have with us or about future changes to this Privacy Policy;
to administer and enforce the rules of contests, sweepstakes, promotions and games offered by us and/or the terms of our commercial dealings;
for our internal business and administrative purposes;
to assist in law enforcement purposes and to meet requirements imposed by law or for claims-related purposes;
for safety or security purposes;
to verify your identity for admission into our park and resort facilities;
other purposes directly relating to any of the above.
We may take your personal information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). We may use this non-personally identifiable information for, among other purposes, research and analysis to improve our products and services.
From time to time, you may decide to “opt in” to, or to “opt out” from, use by us of your personal information for promotional and marketing purposes. If you do not wish to receive promotional and marketing material from us, please inform us by writing to the address in section 10 of this Privacy Policy or sending us an e-mail. Any such request should clearly state details of the personal information in respect of which the request is being made.
4. With whom may we share your personal information that we collect?
All personal information will be kept confidential but we may disclose such information to third parties where such disclosure is necessary to fulfill one or more of the purposes described in section 3 of this Privacy Policy. A list of classes of persons (who may be located within or outside of Hong Kong) to whom your personal data may be transferred can be found at the List of Potential Transferees of Personal Data. For the types of personal data subject to this sharing, please refer to Section 2 of this Privacy Policy. The Data Controller relating to the collection of your personal data by means other than via HongKongDisneyland.com and applications with associated branding shall be construed to mean Hongkong International Theme Parks Limited, jointly with Hongkong Disneyland Management Limited.
From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses (or portions thereof) and your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale. In the event that we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so. In the event that we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy). In light of this protection, your opt-out choices described in section 3 above will not affect our right to transfer your information to a purchaser in these circumstances. The provisions of this paragraph will also apply in the event that one or more businesses of any other member of The Walt Disney Family of Companies are sold and personal information subject to this Privacy Policy is transferred to a purchaser of those businesses.
Information We Obtain from Disney Interactive
5. What types of personal information may we obtain from Disney Interactive?
Disney Interactive is a member of The Walt Disney Family of Companies. We may obtain from Disney Interactive the same types of personal information as described in section 2 of this Privacy Policy.
6. How may we use and share personal information that we obtain from Disney Interactive?

Security
7. What kind of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable information?
The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access and improper use. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
Retention of Personal Information
8. How long may we keep your personal information?
We will not keep personal information longer than is necessary for the fulfillment of the purpose (including any directly related purpose) for which the information is or is to be used. This means that, for example, personal information collected to fulfill your request for goods and services will be erased, deleted, destroyed or anonymized after their delivery by using technical or other means to render such information unidentifiable or unusable, unless it is necessary to keep such information for other purposes and we have informed you of such other purposes at the time of collection of the personal information or obtained your consent.
Amendments to Privacy Policy
9. How will you know if we amend this Privacy Policy?
We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time. If we amend this Privacy Policy to permit material changes in the way we collect, use and/or share your personal information, we will notify you of such changes by sending you an e-mail at the last e-mail address that you provided to us, and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our Web site at www.hongkongdisneyland.com. Any such material changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective thirty (30) calendar days following either our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or our posting of notice of the changes on our Web site. Any such material changes to this Privacy Policy may affect our use and sharing of personal information that we collected before our notification to you of the changes. If you do not wish to permit material changes in our collection, use or sharing of your personal information collected by us before the effective date of such changes, you must so notify us before that effective date by writing to us as described in section 10 below. Please be advised, however, that, regardless of whether you provide such notice to us, the changes to this Privacy Policy will apply to any personal information collected by us on or after the effective date of such changes.
