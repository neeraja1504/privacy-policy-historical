Manage our organisation effectively and continually improve what we do
Develop our relationship with you as someone who may want to collaborate with us
Inform future programming of events including better understanding of specific locations and tailoring work to specific audiences.
Encourage bookings for our events and donations in order for us to be less dependent on funding – according to what marketing communications you have agreed to:
to communicate with you about ourselves, our work, future shows, other fun stuff that we think you might find interesting, and opportunities to support us
to communicate with you about upcoming auditions.
to communicate with you about training and workshops
Although we sometimes will tell you about work from others, we won’t pass information we hold about you to them – unless you explicitly give us your permission.
Any feedback you give us we may use in public communications. But we won’t do so in such a way that people would know it was from you – unless we get your permission.
We may share information about you with other organisations who help us deliver services to you but this will always be under the same conditions as we are bound by under this privacy policy.
We may share information about you with law enforcement agencies or other organisations or individuals if we are obliged to by law.
3.2 Use of anonymised data
The information about you we use to demonstrate the impact and reach of our work to funders is anonymised.
We use a third party provider, Google Analytics, to collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns, for example, what you look at or access, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, information about your computer, including – where your browser provides this – your IP address, operating system and browser type. This information is anonymised, and we will make no attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website.
We use a third party provider, TT Mail, a white label version of Dotmailer, to deliver our e-newsletters. Through MailChimp we gather statistics around email opening and clicks which are not personally identifiable.
We also analyse data from our social media platforms in order to improve our performance and engagement on these platforms.
Web Logs
Every time someone visits our website a log file is generated on our computer. The log file records the time and date of your visit, the files that were requested, your IP (Internet Protocol) address, the referrer URL (if provided) and the browser version. We collect this information to help us diagnose problems and administer our systems and to audit the geographical make-up of users and how they have arrived at our site; that is, from what other sites have visitors arrived – this information being obtained from the referrer URL.
We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that you remain anonymous even though we include your IP address in our aggregate information. However, we can and will attempt to use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our terms and conditions, or to protect our services and other users.
