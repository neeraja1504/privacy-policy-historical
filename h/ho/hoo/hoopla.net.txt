Like other Internet sites, Hoopla uses IP addresses to collect aggregate information about numbers of visitors and Site usage. Hoopla reserves the right to use IP addresses to identify individuals if (1) Hoopla is required to disclose such information by any applicable law or legal process (like a subpoena or court order); or (2) Hoopla is required to do so to protect the safety of the public or other users of the Service, to enforce the Terms of Use, or otherwise to protect our rights.
