Users may be able to draw connections to personally identify you in association with your Member account should you include enough personal information in the content you post publicly, such as street name, photos of your home, or even based on similar usernames and / or avatars (aka Profile Photos) utilised on other third-party sites that potentially reveals more personal information about you.
In support of your privacy, We allow pseudonyms as usernames, and in fact, encourage use of never-used-before pseudonyms and avatars.
Private messages you send or receive using our Service remain private to the degree that both sender and receiver commits to keeping the messages private. For example, if you send a message to another Member, that Member in question may choose to publicly post your private message.
