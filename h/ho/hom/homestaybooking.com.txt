Cookies
Cookies are used on the Website to facilitate users in accessing their accounts and keep your session (i.e. to prevent the system asking for a login at every page). We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and/or to save your personal preferences so you do not have to re-enter them each time you connect to the Website. Our cookies are not made available to other websites. We furthermore use cookies to understand where you come from, for example to see if you clicked on one of our paid Google or Facebook Ads, or if you come from one of our Affiliate websites, to whom we may need to pay commissions.
Our website also uses additional third party services, such as Google Analytics, AddThis, and more, that allow us to provide enhanced functionality and/or gather stats about the website usage. For a full list of cookies used please refer to Cookie Settings page: https://www.homestay.com/cookie_settings.
Whenever you use the Website or our apps, cookies and other tracking technologies are used in various ways. This statement explains how and why we use these technologies and the choices you have.
A cookie is a small amount of data that is placed in the browser of your computer or on your mobile device. For example, a cookie allows us to recognize your browser, while another could store what pages you visited. Two types of cookies are used on the Website: “session cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session cookies normally expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your device after you close your browser, and can be used again the next time you access the Website. We strive to serve cookies or allow the serving of cookies with the minimum reasonable lifespan possible.
On top of cookies, other tracking technologies are used on the Website. These include tracking pixels, software libraries that send your activity to our servers and tracking URLs. These technologies can be used to retrieve information from your device, such as device type, screen size, operating system, IP address, and time of visit. These can serve and read cookies in your browser. Tracking pixels are tiny transparent images that help us confirm when you visit a given page. Software libraries help us understand the actions, if any, you have taken on a page, for example to understand if you are “present” to receive a video call, or if a message is best delivered as a pop up in the browser or as a follow up SMS.
Why Homestay.com Uses These Technologies
We use cookies for different purposes. Cookies allow you to be recognised as the same user across the pages of the Website or when you use an app. Information that we collect through cookies include IP address; device; viewed pages; browser type; screen size; operating system; internet service provider; timestamp; referring URL; and features used or activities engaged in within the Website/apps.
Below outlines our use of different types of cookies:
1. Necessary Functionality and Session Cookies
We use session cookies to remember when you are logged in, so we don’t need to ask you to sign in for every page you visit. We also implement functionality cookies to remember your preferences and to help you to use the Website and apps efficiently and effectively. If you are using the Website or apps to search for a homestay, these functionality cookies remember your preferred currency and language, and if you have already seen and dismissed information popups and dialogs.
Lastly, we use technical cookies to optimize delivery of pages through our content distribution network and to enable libraries for live chat, instant messaging and video calls.
All of the above are “first party cookies” and are essential for the Website to function correctly and therefore are always enabled.
A minimal amount of “third party cookies” are required for important features of the Website, such as live chat to support our customers. These can be turned off in your browser settings if required.
2. Performance / Analytics Cookies
We use these cookies to gain insight into how visitors use the Website. This helps us understand what works and what doesn't, allowing us to optimize and improve the Website and apps. The data we gather can include which of the Website pages you have visited, which referring/exit pages you have entered and left from and which emails you opened. We use analytics cookies as part of our digital marketing campaigns to learn how users interact with the Website or apps.
These are “first party cookies”, required by us to maintain our level of service and therefore are always enabled.
3. Optional And Third Party Cookies
Some of our services are supplied by third parties, some of which make use of cookies to provide their services or enable their integration with the Website. These cookies help us provide more features or optimise our marketing campaigns.
AddThis :
"Add This" is a button which allows the sharing of Website pages on social networks. Add This also sets cookies which track the usage of the service and may be used to deliver advertisements which are of interest to you.
Google Advertising & Conversion:
We use third-party cookies to display relevant advertisements on the Website and on other websites. This is called “remarketing,” and it is based on your browsing activities. Remarketing cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. For more information on Google Remarketing, please see here.
To measure return on investment with Google AdWords, we use the AdWords conversion tracking cookie. Google uses a different cookie for each Google AdWords customer and there is no consolidation of the cookie data with other data. If you click on one of our Ads and proceed to a page including a conversion tag, and the cookie has not yet expired, the conversion is recorded.
Facebook Advertising Conversion :
We also use the Facebook Pixel for measuring conversions from our advertising and remarketing campaigns on Facebook. This pixel allows us to understand and deliver ads and make them more relevant to you. The collected data remains anonymous and we cannot see the personal data of any individual user. The collected data is saved and processed by Facebook. See Facebook’s Data Use Statement: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy.
