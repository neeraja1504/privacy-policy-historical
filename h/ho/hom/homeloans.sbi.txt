SBI Home Loan
Privacy Policy
Privacy Statement
The origin of SBI dates back to 1806 when the Bank of Calcutta (later called the Bank of Bengal) was established. In 1921, the Bank of Bengal and two other Presidency banks (Bank of Madras and Bank of Bombay) were amalgamated to form the Imperial Bank of India. In 1955, the controlling interest in the Imperial Bank of India was acquired by the Reserve Bank of India and the SBI (SBI) came into existence by an act of Parliament as successor to the Imperial Bank of India. In the Indian Financial world, SBI is synonymous with trust and security.
In line with recognized international practice, and for the information of customers and others, who visit the Bank's website, we believe it is necessary to post a privacy statement. The information shared with the Bank will be treated as private. We also desire to say explicitly that adequate precautions have been taken to protect information relating to customers and their dealings with the Bank from miscreants and fraudsters.
Customer confidentiality and privacy are of utmost concern to SBI. Our employees treat the information we have concerning your accounts in the same responsible and confidential manner that we want our own financial affairs treated.
