The Privacy Notice describes:
• What we collect,
• how to opt out of cookies,

We may collect certain personal information from you in connection with your activities at HomeGoods , such as when you shop in our stores or interact with us online. This information may include:

Additionally, we or companies acting on our behalf may collect certain computer and browser information through automated technologies such as cookies and web beacons when you visit our websites (whether or not you have signed in as a register user) or otherwise interact with us online. A “cookie” is a file that is sent to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to identify the browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.
The information collected using these tools may include your IP address, the address of the web page that referred you to our websites, dates and times of websites visits and the location of your device. These automated technologies also permit the collection of “clickstream data,” which may include a log of content you access while browsing a website. Companies acting on our behalf may combine the information collected from your visit to our website (s) with other information they have collected previously.
Opt-Out From and/or Restrict Cookies
Your web browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict, reject or disable certain cookies (but please note that we do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals from web browsers). Additionally, you may opt-out of data collection from certain companies that we use to collect information.

Such third-party service providers are given the information that they need to perform their designated functions and we do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information for their own or any others' marketing purposes.
When you create an account on our mobile apps, we may display that information to other users of the apps.
When you apply for the TJX Rewards™ Card, we share the information you provide with the financial institution that issues the card, and it is that institution’s privacy policy that applies to the information you provide on the TJX Rewards™ Card application.
We may also disclose information about you as is required by law or legal process such as subpoenas or court or agency orders, or as we may reasonably determine to be necessary or appropriate to protect our rights or the rights of others, to avert loss or harm to persons or property, to enforce our Terms of Use or this Privacy Notice, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity.
