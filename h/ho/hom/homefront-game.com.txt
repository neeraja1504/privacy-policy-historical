4. How does THQ use the information it collects?
Generally, information that we collect for a particular purpose is used for that purpose only. For example, if you request product support, the email address that you provide will only be used for purposes of diagnosing your specific technical problem and providing an acceptable solution. Information collected from those who register on the THQ Properties is used to provide registrants the benefits associated with such registration (e.g., subscription to newsletter or access to the latest game news and exclusive store promotions). And, of course, any credit card information is solely used to fulfill and process purchase orders. In some instances, however, you may also be given the option to have your information used for an activity or service different from the activity or service that you are requesting (e.g., to have your name entered into a contest when subscribing to our newsletter or vice versa). If you choose to receive these additional services, THQ will use your information to provide them to you.
We may use your email address to send you service-related announcements that tell you about updates to our Privacy Policy, new areas or features on our THQ Properties, changes to our online service or technical support policies, and other related changes.
We may also use your personal, demographic and third party provided information, both individually and combined together, for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you, to troubleshoot technical problems, to enforce our Terms of Use, to provide you with promotional materials and notice of special events that may be of interest to you, to better tailor our game play experience to you and to better meet your needs.  Demographic information may also be used to display user IDs, game user leader boards, game statistics, to identify tournament participants on our websites, or other similar purposes.
Please be advised that in some areas of the THQ Properties, you may be able to submit information about yourself in a business capacity. Although we can assure you that any personal information gathered in this context will be used solely for its intended purpose, such information is not subject to this Privacy Policy. These areas typically include an employment section where you can submit your resume online and/or an investors relations section where you can fill out an online form to request financial information about THQ.
Except as set forth herein, THQ does not sell, market, trade, or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information to third parties outside of our company.
5. What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information to THQ?
If you choose not to submit personal information when requested, you may not be able to participate in certain activities on the THQ Properties and may limit the services we can provide you. For example, if you refuse to share your email address, you may not be able to receive general support or product support. To simply browse the THQ Properties, however, you do not need to give us any personal information. Regardless of whether you register with THQ, certain demographic information (such as user ID, in-game achievements, gameplay statistics or leader boards) collected through the use of the THQ Properties or any THQ products or services may be published by THQ to further the online gameplay experience of users.
6. Does THQ use cookies, track IP addresses, or use other passive means to collect information?

Web Beacons
We may use web beacons (or clear GIFs) on the THQ Properties or include them in the e-mail messages we send you. Web beacons (also known as "web bugs") are small strings of code that provide a method of delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. We use web beacons for many purposes, including site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising and email auditing and reporting, and personalization. Information gathered through web beacons may be linked to your personal information.
IP Addresses
THQ may also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to troubleshoot technical concerns and to maintain website safety and security. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.

These entries are generated anonymously, and help THQ determine (among other things) user hardware specifications, how many and how often users have visited the THQ Properties, which pages they've visited, and other similar data (a.k.a., navigational data). We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user, computer, or browser, though they may contain your IP address.
Authentication
THQ may implement security measures from time to time in ensure that participants on the THQ Properties and for services offered via the THQ Properties are individuals rather than web crawlers, bots, or other automated programs.  These authentication measures ensure a smooth and safe user experience.
Ad Serving Networks
THQ Properties may employ proprietary or third party ad serving technologies that use Technical Methods or other technologies to collect information as a result of ad serving through our products or services as well as to help track results.  Some dynamic in-game advertisement serving technology enable advertising to be temporarily uploaded into your game, web browser or mobile device and replaced while you are online.  We or third parties operating the advertisement serving technology may use information such as age and gender as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the site, online or mobile product or service  and to calculate or control the number of unique and repeat views of a given ad, and/or deliver ads that relate to your interests and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.   We or third parties may collect demographic information for this purpose as well as advertisement(s) served, in game location, length of time an advertisement was visible, other Internet and website usage information, web pages and mobile internet sites which have been viewed by you (as well as date and time), domain type, size of the advertisement, advertisement response (if any), and angle of view.  The foregoing data may be used and disclosed per this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology.
The advertising companies who deliver ads for us may combine the information collected or obtained from THQ with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and services relating to your web browser's activities across their network of websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.

Vendors are required to handle such information in accordance terms no less strict than those set forth in this Privacy Policy.
From time to time, we may run contests, tournaments, or other events or activities (" Events ") on the THQ Properties. Information collected for these Events may include personal information such as your email address and may be collected by or shared with a third party sponsor, co-sponsor, or other reputable third party (e.g., promotional partner, software licensee, or game developer).

If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events at the time the information is collected.
The THQ Properties or their purchase pages may display an "offer wall" that is hosted by an offer wall provider. The offer wall allows third party advertisers to provide certain in-game benefits, such as in-game currency, to users in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with one of those advertisers. These offers may be displayed to you based on certain technical information, such as your geographic area or anonymous demographic information and are not offers made by THQ. After clicking on one of these advertisements, you will no longer be at a THQ Website and THQ privacy policy shall not apply to any transactions completed on such website.

THQ recognizes the importance of protecting the personal information of children.  As a result, THQ and the THQ Properties do no knowingly collect or store any personal information such as name, address or email address from children under 13.  We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their name, address, phone number, email address of other identifying information online without their prior consent.
Please note, that from time to time, certain portions of the THQ Properties may allow children under 13 to disclose a limited amount of personal information without first telling us their age or getting their parent's permission. Such portions of the THQ Properties operate activities or provide services in a way that does not require prior parental consent.
12. What safeguards does THQ use to protect my personal information?
THQ takes reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information collected from our website visitors. Personal information collected by THQ is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and that are only accessible to authorized employees. In addition, our online store uses industry-standard encryption to prevent unauthorized electronic access to sensitive financial information such as your credit card number. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, disclosure, destruction and alteration of the information under our control. For example, before we allow web users to access their personal information, we verify their identity by requesting information such as their username and password. No method of electronic transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure however, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of such transmission or information.
Although we cannot guarantee that third parties to whom we transfer personal data will adhere to the security standards set forth above, we will take reasonable measures, such as contractual obligations, to assure that they provide sufficient protection over such data.
