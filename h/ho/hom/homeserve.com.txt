Use Of Cookies, Web Beacons, And Other De-identified Data Collection
Like most websites, We make use of browser “cookies”.  A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier.  When You visit a website, that site’s computer asks Your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies.  Each website can send its own cookie to Your browser if Your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect Your privacy) Your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to You, not the cookies sent to You by other sites.  You can manage or disable Your cookies by using tools of Your browser.  If You choose to disable cookies, We will not store certain Information You provide to Us.  However, if You do choose to remove cookies or reject cookies it may affect certain features or services of Our Website.  For more information regarding the protocol We use when You disable Your browser’s cookies, click here.
As You browse Our Website, the Website uses its cookies to differentiate You from other users in order to prevent You from seeing offers inapplicable to You or requiring You to log in more than is necessary for security.  Cookies, in conjunction with Our web server’s log files, allow Us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting Our Website and determine which parts of the Website are most popular.  This helps Us gather feedback in order to constantly improve Our Website and better serve Our customers.  Generally, the cookies used on Our Website do not allow Us to gather any Personal Information about You.    However, should You make a purchase through Our web order process, We require You to submit certain Personal Information (e.g. name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number) and Financial Information in order to checkout.  If You set up an account with HomeServe through Our web order process, We store and maintain a record of Your Information, including Your Financial Information associated with the purchase.  We do not store Financial Information through Our cookies.  HomeServe will never use cookies to retrieve Information from a computer that is unrelated to Our Website or services.
We may collect Information using web beacons.  Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in Our services or in Our e-mails.  We use web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and tell if an e-mail has been opened and acted upon.
HomeServe may share some Information with others, in aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the Information will not contain any personally identifiable information about You or any other person.  As such, third party cookies do not track Your personal data from Our Website over time or across different websites.  However, HomeServe is not responsible for third party cookies when You leave Our Website and enter a third party website.  Please see the “Third Party Websites and Interaction” section below for more information.
Opt Out Unsubscribe Access Questions And Further Information
At Your request, and where required by law, We will confirm, and/or update the Information We hold about You.  We may have to verify Your identity first.
