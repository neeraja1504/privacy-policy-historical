The Information Collected and How It Is Used
At Hostdeal.com, we are committed to protecting your privacy. The limited information we do collect is used to provide you with a personalized experience, better service, and at times, bring you value-added offers from our partners.
Cookies
Our site uses cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your encrypted password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. Also, we use cookies to make sure you don’t see the same ad repeatedly.
E-mail & Demographic Data
Our site’s registration form requires users to give us contact information (i.e. name and e-mail address) and demographic information (i.e. interests and business information). We may use contact information from the registration form to send you a weekly hostdeal.com newsletter, and to send you information that may help your business grow. The customer’s contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary (i.e. customer support issues). Users may later opt-out of receiving future mailings if they have opted-in initially; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the customer’s experience at our site, showing content that we think might be of interest, and displaying the content according to customer preferences.
Online Surveys
At times we conduct completely voluntary online surveys where we ask for contact information and solicit feedback on various topics from visitors. We use the collected data from such surveys to fine tune our product and service offerings. And we use contact data to follow-up with you to highlight the changes we have made to our business based on your feedback.
Contests
We run contests on our site from time to time where we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.
Public Forums
This site may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
