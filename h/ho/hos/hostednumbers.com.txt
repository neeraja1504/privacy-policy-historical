Privacy Policy for HostedNumbers.com
Our Commitment to You
PATLive is not a financial institution but we do need to collect some private information in order to extend credit to our clients and to service their accounts. We value the privacy of this information, we take all reasonable measures to keep it secure and we do not sell it to anyone. We are committed to protecting this information and to keeping it private.
Our Privacy Principles
1) We minimize the amount of personal information we ask for.
2) We secure personal information and restrict access to it.
3) We do not and will not sell your personal information.
4) Our privacy policy applies to clients, former clients, prospects and Web site visitors.
5) We comply with all laws and proceedings regarding the privacy of information.
The Information We Collect
We collect the information needed to transact business with clients who select our services. The focus is on minimizing the information we need while making it easy to do business with us. All personal information is explicitly provided by clients when they set up their PATLive account. This includes the information we need to stay in contact with them (such as their email address), to collect payment from them (such as a credit card number) and to extend credit to them (such as a Social Security or federal tax number).
The information We Report
PATLive has business relationships with organizations that promote PATLive services to its members. PATLive also has business relationships with other businesses who refer or sign up new PATLive clients for a fee. For business auditing purposes, PATLive provides a monthly audit report to these affiliates so that they can track the members and referrals who are active with PATLive. This audit report provides the client name and monthly invoice amount and may include other information about account activity as it relates to the member's organization. PATLive does not sell client information to third parties.
We reserve the right to disclose information in special cases. An example of a special case is when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our web site, rights or property. Another example of a special case is when we have a reasonable request from government authorities at the federal, state or local level.
