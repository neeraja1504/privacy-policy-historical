Hospitality-Industry.com | Privacy policy
Last Revised: September 26st, 2007
Hospitality-Industry.com Corporation and our subsidiaries and affiliates ("Hospitality-Industry.com" or "we") respect your preferences concerning the collection and use of your personal information ("data"). Our goal is to deliver content targeted to accommodate your stay. In order to provide you with relevant information, fulfill your specific requests, and enhance your experience across our Web site, we will at times request data from you. This policy lets you know how we collect data, why we collect it, and what choices you have concerning its use.
This is the privacy policy for the Hospitality-Industry.com Web site. This policy describes the broadest potential use of data throughout the Hospitality-Industry.com web site. Parts of the site may make far less use of data than we have outlined in the policy. Please note that Hospitality-Industry.com maintains the same privacy practices described in this policy for data we collect through our call center; accordingly, references below to Web site "users" also apply to individuals from whom we collect data off-line.
In order to provide service in a timely, cost effective and efficient manner, data provided to Hospitality-Industry.com may be made available to authorized Hospitality-Industry.com users across our global offices that require access to the data for business purposes.
2. Types of Data Collection
Hospitality-Industry.com collects data related to our users through the following methods:
Automated means such as communications protocols and cookies
Registration screens and online forms
Sales inquiries and transactions
Customer communications
Offline communications and interactions
Third party sources of information, such as opt in lists.
Depending upon the method of collection and use, the data collected may include information about the user from forms, registrations and transactions (such as name, title, address, company, phone number and e-mail address), financial/transaction information (such as credit card and payment information), information about use of Hospitality-Industry.com web sites (such as electronic communications protocols, web pages visited and cookies) and user preferences (including product requirements, areas of industry interest, newsletters, community choices and other information managed from the customer profile that is created when registering on Hospitality-Industry.com).
Electronic Communications Protocols and Cookies:
Hospitality-Industry.com may receive data from you as part of the communication connection itself, that is, the standard electronic greeting between your computer and our servers. This information often consists of network routing (where you came from), equipment information (browser type), date and time. At this time our server will also query your computer to see if there are "cookies" previously set by Hospitality-Industry.com to facilitate log in or other site navigation procedures. A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web server to store on a Web browser so it can later be read back from that browser.
Cookies: Some parts of the Hospitality-Industry.com site use cookies to collect information about visitors' use of the Web site and to facilitate return visits. The information collected from cookies is tracked to enhance security and/or to improve the functionality of the Web site by avoiding duplicate data entry, facilitating navigation, and increasing the relevance of content. Cookies on the site may collect the following information: a unique identifier, user preferences and profile information used to personalize the content that is shown, and membership information to access your Hospitality-Industry.com account. Cookies on the site, and the associated data, may be used for the purposes stated in Section 3 below. Some cookies used by Hospitality-Industry.com may remain on the user's computer after they leave the Web site, but the majority is set to expire within 30 - 365 days. (As discussed in more detail below, you can set your browser to alert you to cookies being placed, in which case a prompt screen will describe information about the cookie, its duration, and the server to which it is being returned.) There may be some cookies on certain tools that are of longer duration. Cookies may also be of benefit to you by creating a more streamlined login process, keeping track of shopping cart additions and preserving order information between sessions. In the future, as we enable further customization of the site, cookies will help in assuring that information provided to you will be the most relevant to your needs.
While we do not offer an opt-out on the site for cookies, browsers provide you with information and control over cookies. You can set your Web browser to alert you when a cookie is being used. You can also get information on the duration of the cookie and what server your data is being returned to. You then have the opportunity to accept or reject the cookie. Additionally, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or accept only cookies returned to the originating servers. Users can generally disable the cookie feature on their browser without affecting their ability to use the site, except in some cases where cookies are used as an essential security feature necessary for transaction completion.
Embedded URLs: In order to provide maximum site utility, Hospitality-Industry.com also uses a tracking technique that uses embedded URLs to allow use of the site without cookies. Embedded URLs manifest themselves as plain text or encoded extensions to the URL that appears in the browser address or location toolbar. This technology allows limited information to follow you as you navigate the site, but is not identified to personal data and is not used beyond the session. While this increases your ability to surf the site, it does not replace the functionality or streamlining of cookies and may limit your use of many convenience features offered by the site.
Embedded Pixels: In an effort to provide users with the most relevant Web site content and marketing materials, we may also use embedded pixel technologies to help track site usage and marketing campaign responsiveness. On the Web site, these technologies are used on selected pages for the purposes of identifying unique user visits as opposed to aggregate hits. The site usage information collected by these technologies is associated with cookies and may provide data about site use by registered users of Hospitality-Industry.com web sites. This information is used to evaluate site content, navigability and composition as well as page response rates. When these technologies are used in emails, they provide information on when the email was opened.
Third Party Cookies: Hospitality-Industry.com has engaged Google Analytics, a third party, to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information (which does not include personally identifiable information) from visitors to the Web site to help us continue to improve the quality of our Web site. Google Analytics uses cookies to help track visitor behavior and sets cookies on behalf of Hospitality-Industry.com that will be listed under the domain Hospitality-Industry.com. Google Analytics does not use cookies to relate Web site visitors to any personally identifiable information. Google Analytics provides Hospitality-Industry.com with information about site usage that reflects individual behavior of visitors, but not their identity. All data collected by Google Analytics on behalf of Hospitality-Industry.com is used only to provide us with information on site usage and is not shared with any other third parties. Urchin information is unique to the individual, but not personally identifiable by Google Analytics. Google Analytics provides Hospitality-Industry.com with this information which we re-associate with previously collected registration information for purposes specified in this policy, but in the main to:
Select content based on registration data and movement through the site
Tailor marketing to users' needs
Aggregate web activity based on user registration attributes

Hospitality-Industry.com collects data from users for the following purposes:
As a result of your site navigation: Data may be collected to help personalize Web site content and enable navigation that is most relevant and user friendly.

Hospitality-Industry.com may need to share some of this data (address, payment) with delivery services, credit card clearing houses and other similarly situated third parties that are required to accomplish the transaction.
As a result of referral "tell a friend" functions. If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Hospitality-Industry.com will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Hospitality-Industry.com uses this data for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. The friend may contact Hospitality-Industry.com at
privacy (at) Hospitality-Industry.com
to be removed from the referral program.
As a result of your participation in interactive discussions, public forums & reviews systems. There are parts of the Web site that permit you to participate in interactive discussions. Some of these are moderated; all are subject to access for technical reasons. Hospitality-Industry.com does not control the content that users post and some may serve as public discussion forums. As in any interactive forum open to many users, you should carefully consider whether you wish to submit data and should tailor any other content submitted appropriately.
As a result of legal requirements. Hospitality-Industry.com may be required to provide data to comply with legally mandated reporting, disclosure or other legal process requirements.
4.Customization, Preferences and Opt-Out
Establishing an online registration profile at Hospitality-Industry.com allows visitors the ability to opt in (or out) of communities and provides them with control over their preferences for electronic information delivery.
Communications Choices. Hospitality-Industry.com recognizes that users may not wish to be contacted about new or related products. Hospitality-Industry.com allows you to opt out of some, or all, email marketing that may result from use of the site. These choices are established and modified via your online registration profile. A link to this profile will be available in marketing emails. You can return to the registration profile at any time to change your elections or modify your profile at http://www.hospitality-industry.com/index.php/member/login/ or you can send an email to our general unsubscribe automated link at

privacy (at) Hospitality-Industry.com
, indicate opt-out in the subject line and specify what problem you have encountered in the body of the message.
Third Party Permission-Based Lists. On occasion, Hospitality-Industry.com may use a third party permission-based list to send communications about Hospitality-Industry.com products and services. These are lists maintained by third parties whose users have consented to receive emails from other companies, such as Hospitality-Industry.com. We do not have access to the names and contact information on these lists; the third party that has the direct relationship with these users maintains the list and the opt-outs, removes, and unsubscribes. We require the list owners to identify themselves as the mailers of the email and to provide appropriate opt-out mechanisms. If you wish to be removed from a third-party list, you should direct your opt-out request to the list owner, not to Hospitality-Industry.com. Nevertheless, if you have trouble opting out, or if you wish to make us aware of any issues related to a third-party mailing, you may contact us directly at
privacy (at) Hospitality-Industry.com
. When third-party mailings are sent with an Hospitality-Industry.com reply address, Hospitality-Industry.com also will provide a notice with information about how to opt-out of future Hospitality-Industry.com marketing communications.
Please contact us at
privacy (at) Hospitality-Industry.com
if you believe you have mistakenly received information after opting out or if you would like to opt out of receiving information and have been unable to use the opt-out mechanisms provided.

In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user data already stored in our database, we will notify you by email or post a prominent notice on this Web site notifying users of the change.
