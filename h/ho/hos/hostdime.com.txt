Each of these Identification Tools work differently, however, they all collect information related to the website you came to HostDime from, a User’s operating system, browser type, where Users go on HostDime’s website, length of time on HostDime’s website, and where a User goes after visiting HostDime’s website. In addition, Identification Tools may keep Users logged into HostDime’s system.

Because the technologies underlying Identification Tools differ, Users may, or may not, be able to choose not to provide information to them.

When Users contact HostDime for support for their services they will be asked to match certain information that is in their Registration Information. This information will be used to identify them personally.

d. FAQ and Forum Information
HostDime offers Users the ability to exchange information about its services, and their experiences with these services (Forum Information). Forum Information is publicly accessible and may be indexed by search engines and other tools.
