§ 3 Principles of data processing
The term personal data refers to all information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. It includes, for instance, information such as your name, age, address, telephone number, date of birth, email address, IP address and user behavior. Information that does not allow us to establish a connection to you as a person (or would only allow such a connection with an unreasonable amount of effort), for instance anonymized information, is not classed as personal data. Processing personal data (for instance collecting, querying, using, storing and transferring personal data) always requires a legal basis or your consent. Processed personal data is deleted as soon as the purpose for which it was collected is fulfilled and statutory retention periods no longer apply.
Insofar as we process your personal data in order to provide specific services to you, the following serves to inform you of the concrete processes, the scope and the purpose of data processing, the legislation on which it is based and the duration of storage in each case.

§ 7 Tracking and analysis tools
We use tracking and analysis tools to ensure our website is continuously optimized and its design is suitable for its purpose. Tracking measures also enable us to collect statistical data with regard to user behavior on our website and to use the insights gained to further improve our online offering for you. These interests justify the use of tracking and analysis tools described below in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 p. 1 (f) GDPR. If you have granted your consent to the use of cookies in response to a notice (“cookie banner”) on the website, then lawfulness is also based on Art. 6 Para. 1 p. 1 (a) GDPR. The purpose of tracking and analysis tools and the data they process can also be referenced from the following descriptions. You can use our website’s cookie settings to activate and deactivate your selection of tracking and analysis tools at any time.
1. Google Analytics
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountainview, CA 94043 USA (“Google”). Google Analytics uses so-called cookies. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and enable an analysis of your use of the website.
The information generated by the cookies about your use of the website, for instance the time, location and frequency of your visits, is usually transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the United States. The collection of other personal data in addition to your IP address by the cookies set by Google Analytics cannot be ruled out when Google Analytics is used. Please note that Google may disclose this information to third parties if required to do so by law or if a third party processes the information on behalf of Google.
Google will use this information on behalf of the website operator for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website and internet usage to the website operator. According to Google, Google will not associate the IP address transferred by your browser within the context of Google Analytics with any other data held by Google.
You can prevent the storage of cookies on your computer by adjusting the corresponding settings in your browser. Please note, however, that you may not be able to use all the functions of this website in full if you do so.
The collection of other personal data in addition to your IP address by the cookies set by Google Analytics cannot be ruled out. In addition to deactivating tracking cookies as described in the preceding, you can also prevent Google Analytics from collecting information about your use of the website and transferring it to Google Analytics by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
This plug-in prevents information about your visit to the website from being sent to Google Analytics. The plug-in does not prevent any other form of analysis.
This website uses Google Analytics with the “anonymizeIp” extension to ensure the best possible protection of your personal data. The code deletes the last 8 bits of IP addresses so that your IP address is anonymized when it is collected (so-called IP masking). Google truncates and therefore anonymizes IP addresses in Member States of the European Union as well as in other countries that are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area before they are sent to the USA. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address sent to and truncated by a Google server in the USA.
2. Google AdWords
We use “Google AdWords” technology in general and, in particular, conversion tracking. Google Conversion Tracking is an analysis service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Clicking on an advertisement placed by Google will install a conversion tracking cookie on your computer. These cookies are valid for 30 days and are not used for personal identification purposes. If you visit certain pages of our website while the cookie is still active, both Google and we can recognize that you clicked on a specific advertisement and were subsequently transferred to this website. Every Google AdWords customer is given a different cookie. It is therefore impossible to track cookies via the websites of AdWords customers.
The data collected by conversion cookies serves to create conversion statistics for AdWords customers who use conversion tracking. Customers receive information on the number of users who clicked on their advertisement and were subsequently transferred to a website with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that would allow users to be personally identified.
If you do not want to participate in conversion tracking, you can prevent this by adjusting your browser’s settings accordingly so that, for instance, setting cookies is generally prohibited. You can also deactivate conversion tracking cookies by adjusting your browser so that only cookies from “googleadservices.com” are blocked.
3. Google Remarketing
We use “Google Remarketing” technology provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Google Remarketing is used to show adverts to users who have already visited our web pages and online services and displayed an interest in a specific offering. This enables targeted, interest-based advertisements within Google’s advertisement network to be displayed on our website. Google Remarketing uses cookies for analysis purposes. They enable the recognition of our visitors as soon as they visit websites participating in Google’s advertising network. These cookies make it possible to display targeted, interest-based advertisements on the basis of websites in Google’s advertisement network that were previously visited by the user (and that also use Google Remarketing).
If you do not wish to see any targeted, interest-based advertisements, you can deactivate Google’s use of cookies via this link: https://www.google.de/settings/ads.
4. ZANOX
We use technology of AWIN AG, Stralauer Allee 2, 10245 Berlin. Should visitors access our website via a link from a ZANOX affiliate network and place an order, the conclusion is anonymously transferred to ZANOX via a trackingcode, to credit a commission to the partner for the conversion. More information can be found at: https://www.awin.com/de/rechtliches/privacy-policy
5. Optimizely
On this website Optimizely, a web analyst serice of Optimizely, Inc. ("Optimizely") is used to facilitate and conduct A/B-Tests to further enhance our website. Optimizely uses cookies to analyze the website. The information stored in the cookie about your using of this website are generally transferred and stored to a server of Optimizely in the USA.
You can deactivate the Optimizely-Tracking at any time (and thus prevent the capturing of the usage data of the cookie – including your IP address – and usage and processing of this data through Optimizely). Information and a possibility to prevent your usage information from being captured by and being transferred to Optimizely can be found, in addition the the previously mentioned possibility of deactivating your tracking cookies, at the following link: https://www.optimizely.com/opt_out/
6. Qualaroo
Qualaroo LLC., PO Box 29502 #18534, Las Vegas, Nevada 48084, USA, provides us with a solution for website surveys and analysis to enhance user experience. Qualaroo does not receive personal identifiable information, all contents are anonymized. More information can be found at: https://qualaroo.com/privacy-policy/
7. Bing
Bing Conversion Tracking from Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052- 6399, USA – can store a temporary cookie on your computer if you click on one of our adverts at Bing or on select websites of the Bing-network. Should you reach our website via such a conversion page, your clicking of the advert will be stored with us and Microsoft Bing. This enables us to create conversion-statistics, which means tracking how many users conduct and order after being referred to us via a conversion site.
More information and a possibility to prevent capturing of information of your website usage through Bing Ads and this being transferred to Microsoft can be found, in addition the the previously mentioned possibility of deactivating your tracking cookies, at the following link: http://choice.microsoft.com/de.
8. Google reCAPTCHA
For increased security of some of our sites we use the service reCAPTCHA from Google Inc. This helps in distinguishing whether site calls are made by a natural person or by machine or automated processing. For this, the IP address and any other data required by Google for the reCAPTCHA service is sent to Google. For more information about the Google Inc. privacy policy, see http://www.google.de/intl/de/privacy or https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy.
9. Facebook Retargeting
We use the retargeting function of Facebook Ireland Limited Hanover Reach, 5-7 Hanover Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland. The function allows users of our website to be targeted with advertising on our partner's website. This is done using cookies and analyzing user behavior. Neither personal data is stored nor any usage profiles are merged with personal data.
This function is only applicable if you have agreed to the use of advertising-related cookies in the cookie settings. The function can be disabled at any time under https://www.facebook.com/ads/website_custom_audiences.
10. Lead Inspector
For the statistical evaluation of visitor access, Lead Inspector GmbH uses technologies to collect, process and store data for marketing purposes and to identify web visitors. The Lead Inspector GmbH technology uses this data to determine addresses, but only in cases where it can ensure that the visitor is a company and not a single person. Cookies can be used for this purpose. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and allow an analysis of your use of the website. The company data collected by Lead Inspector GmbH may also contain personal data. Lead Inspector GmbH may use information left behind by visits to the websites in order to create anonymous user profiles. Insofar as IP addresses are collected, they are made anonymous immediately after collection by deleting the last block of numbers.
Lead Inspector GmbH's collection and storage of data for this website can be contradicted at any time with future effect under https://www.leadinspector.de/widerspruch.
11. Aklamio
This website uses the "Conversion tracking pixel" of Aklamio GmbH, Hagelberger Str. 11, 10965 Berlin. After clicking on a referral link belonging to the Aklamio advertising network, a cookie for conversion tracking is stored on your system. This shows us via which partner you reached our site. Also a completed order can be traced and assigned to its origin. The purpose of the processing is to be able to understand the scope of advertising measures and to process commission payments. You can prevent the storage of cookies by appropriate settings of the browser. These measures will still allow you to continue to visit our platforms, but in this case orders cannot be assigned and therefore no premium can be paid out. For more information, please visit: www.aklamio.com/privacy?locale=en.
§ 8 Hyperlinks
Our website contains so-called hyperlinks to websites operated by other providers. Activating a hyperlink will transfer you directly to the website of the corresponding provider. You can recognize the transfer by the change of URL, for example. We cannot accept any liability for the confidential use of your data on these websites as we have no influence on the compliance of these companies with data protection regulations. Please refer directly to the website concerned to obtain information on how your personal data is handled.
