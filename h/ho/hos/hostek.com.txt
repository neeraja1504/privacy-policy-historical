Hostek is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Hostek may collect information from our customers at several different points on our website, as needed to service our customers, as outlined below.

There are a couple types of cookies related to the web browsing experience. Neither cookie type contains any personally identifiable information. A temporary cookie, technically known as a Session Cookie, is one that your browser sets by default to communicate your browsing experience between you and the server. This session cookie is automatically destroyed in your browser when you close the web browsing session on the Hostek site.
The second cookie type is known as a persistent cookie. A persistent cookie is a small bit of data stored locally on your machine that help with the overall browsing experience.
Hostek in general does not utilize the use of persistent cookies for the site to function properly. However, these cookies can help us provide a more tailored experience for Customer based on the type of product Customer has expressed interest in and in the way a customer chooses to utilize the services. The types of persistent cookies Hostek utilizes is for tracking how and when you initially found Hostek including what page you first landed on. Additionally, third party cookies such as Google and Facebook for example, are set to help us track our advertising effectiveness.

INFORMATION COLLECTED DURING ORDER PROCESS
We request information from the user on our order form(s). In order for us to service Customer account, here a user must provide contact information (email, name, address, phone) and depending on payment method, financial information (credit card number, expiration date, bank information). Additionally the IP is recorded in the billing system. This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. We use a high encryption SSL certificate for securely gathering the requested information. We also encrypt the credit card information for your security and the CVV code of the card is NOT stored.
LOG FILES
Log files automatically collect certain types of information related to your browser, including your IP address. We use IP addresses to analyze trends and help provide an insight into how visitors transition from one page to another so we can optimize the visitor experience, and gather broad demographic information like the type of browser, for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
SHARING OF INFORMATION
Hostek does NOT share any personal information with any outside company except as outlined here:
Credit/Payment Card Processors - Hostek uses a credit/payment card processing company (just like every business that accepts credit cards has to) to bill users for goods and services. Hostek only passes the required information to the credit card company which includes the name, card number, expiration date and billing zip code. Hostek does NOT forward any personally identifiable information to these card processing companies.
Domain Registration/Transfer - Domain Registrars require domain ownership information. Hostek is required to provide the domain owner information to the Domain Registrars. NOTE: Hostek STRONGLY suggests adding Domains Whois Privacy so that your information is not made public.
SSL Certificates - Certain information must be provided to the certificate issuing authority. This information varies based on the certificate type and at a minimum requires an email address for approval of the certificate. For EV (Extended Validation - green bar) certicates, the certificate issuing authority requires email, company name, address, phone and contact information.
CloudFlare - CloudFlare is used by some customers as a CDN (content distribution network) to help filter bad request and to spread the site assets around the globe for faster load times. CloudFlare requires a customer email address for the CloudFlare account.
SmarterMail Bundle - SmarterMail provides an introductory bundle for customers that are new to SmarterMail. To receive the bundle, SmarterTools, the makers of SmarterMail, require Customer email adddress.
SpamExperts - SpamExperts is a premium Anti-Spam solution that many customers love. SpamExperts requires a customer email for the account, which also allows Customer to login and review quarantined messages and manage settings.
Advanced Online Solutions, Inc, the corporate name of Hostek.com, is the sole owner of Hostek Limited, a Registered Private Company within England and Wales. Hostek.com has staff in the United States and Hostek Limited has staff in the United Kingdom. The staff of both companies work together to take care of our customers around the globe. While these are sister companies which is not applicable to this section, we believe full transparency is best in knowing that as an international company, Hostek has staff in both locations that are available to help our customers, 24/7.
Hostek will comply with State and Federal law and therefore comply with lawful request (ie, court orders, subpoenas, etc.). When allowed, Hostek will notify customer of such request.
LINKS
Company web sites contain links to third party sites. These third party websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for their policies. We encourage our visitors to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Company Web sites.
NEWSLETTER
If a visitor wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address.
SURVEYS & CONTESTS
From time-to-time our site requests information from visitors or customers via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the participant therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.
SECURITY
This website takes every precaution to protect our visitors' information. When visitors submit sensitive information via the website, the information is protected both online and off-line.
When our order form(s) asks visitors to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form(s), the lock icon in the Web browser becomes locked. Hostek has taken additional steps to ensure SSL encryption is used at all times when browing our site.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.
Hostek's website and services are not intended for, nor designed to attract, individuals under the age of 18. Hostek does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from any person under the age of 18.
When paying by Credit Card, upon initial payment, you will be required to enter the CVV code for the card. We do NOT store this code. It is only asked for this once. The card itself is encrypted and stored for your security.
SPECIAL OFFERS
We send all new accounts an email providing new account information. Established customers will occasionally receive information on new services and/or special promotions. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.
CORRECTING/UPDATING/DELETING PERSONAL INFORMATION
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your phone number or email address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the user's Control Panel page or by submitting a support ticket.
