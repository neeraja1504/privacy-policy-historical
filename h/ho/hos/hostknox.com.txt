In order to process payments and deliver the services you request from us, we have to provide the necessary details to the third parties we work with. These third parties are our payment processors (Stripe, PayPal), our domain registrar (TuCows), our SSL vendor (AlphaSSL). These are trusted business affiliates who work together with us and are subject to strict terms and conditions regarding how they process personal data.
If required by law, we will share information with law enforcement agencies in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities.
Neither we at HostKnox.com, nor any of our trusted partners will sell or provide personal data to untrusted/unaffiliated third parties. The data that we and our trusted partners collect and process is used only to deliver the services you request.
