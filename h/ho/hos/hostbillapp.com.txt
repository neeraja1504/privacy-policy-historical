We undertake all reasonable steps to protect your information from misuse and keep it secure.
The Privacy Policy document specifies what kind of information HostBill collects from the website users and explains how this information can be used. Please read the following statement to learn more about our Privacy Policy.

2. Personally Identifiable Information
“Personally identifiable information” is information that we can use to identify you as an individual. Personally identifiable information include your name, address, telephone number and anyother information that is connected with you personally. It is also known as “personal data”.
HostBill collects personally identifiable information only if the customer supplies it voluntarily during the order process on our website or when getting in touch with us using contact form or subscribing to our newsletter.
All personal data is kept in our database and will not be shared with or sold to any third parties, with the exception of financial institutions in cases where identity theft or fraud is suspected and other state or international institutions when it is prescribed by law.
3. Lawfulness of processing
Personally identifiable information is processed by HostBill only for regular business purposes: to deliver products and services, to administrate customer accounts and provide customer support. With your consent, it might be also used for direct marketing purposes.
If you want to buy our products or services, we need your name, surname and, if you have one, company name and VAT number. It is also necessary that you provide us your exact address (street, apartment number, city, province, country), email and telephone address, so that we can contact with you and deliver ordered products. In case you need support, we also keep your login password and the IP address. Processing of those data is necessary for the performance of a contract in which you are a party or in order to undertake steps at your request prior to concluding a contract and for compliance with a legal obligation.
On the other hand, your name and surname, company name, VAT number and address will be used to issue an invoice. It is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation.
In order to verify your identity you will be asked to provide us with a scan of your ID card or bill. Neither those documents nor information they present will be collected in any filing system, but delated immediately after verification. Processing of those data is necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud and ensuring IT security.

You have the right to check whether or not we process your personal data and, when if we process such data, you are entitled to obtain access to the personal data and additional information including details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we can provide you with a copy of your personal data. The first copy provided is free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee. Please remember you can get an access to your personal data by logging into your account on our website.
Moreover you have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed. Remember you can also modify your personal data on your own when logged into your account on our website.
Under some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure.

You have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data if you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data.
You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data for this purpose.
To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is your consent or necessity for the performance of the contract and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other people.
If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection law, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint to a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.
You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by contacting us (by using the contact form on our website).
