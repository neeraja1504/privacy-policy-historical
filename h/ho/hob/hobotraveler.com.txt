E-MAIL PRIVACY ( Ugly and mis-leading tactics... Examples of we DO NOT DO)
I, Andy the Hobo subscribe to lots of newsletters. I am always trying to limit the number of extra emails in my box. This is especially important, because I am a traveler, and work out of Internet Cafes. Extra emails take up time and can be annoying. I am not a big proponent of the crazy anti-spam attackers. I think hitting the delete button is pretty easy, and some folks out there are going overboard in their McCarthyism or Gestapo Techniques. I think this needs to end. But.... the problem has become more complicated, and LARGE WEBSITES LIKE MINE are not becoming a BIG PROBLEM. The large websites learn ways around the rules and are becoming the biggest spammers of them all. Knowledge is power in a sense, and the misuse of this knowledge and power is misguide and sometimes dangerous. So I am going to explain some ways that unethical sites collect your email, and then send advertisements to you
BUSINESS PRACTICES.

This is an ADVERTISEMENT.

Infer or pretend they are being only benevolent to the public, and / or non-profit. And .org on the end, or portraying themselves as donating money to a good cause.
