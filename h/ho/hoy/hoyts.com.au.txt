We refer throughout this Privacy Policy to ‘personal information’ which means information which identifies you as an individual or from which you can reasonably be identified.  Your name, email, address, telephone numbers are all examples of ‘personal information’.
Your personal information is important to us
We are subject to the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).
We respect the importance of your privacy, and that you have a right to make your own choices about how your personal information is collected and used. We know that when you provide personal information to us you are showing your trust and we take that seriously.
You have no obligation to provide any information requested by us.  However, if you choose to withhold your personal information, we may not be able to provide you with the Services or products that depend on the collection and use of that information.
How and what personal information do we collect
We collect your personal information for the HOYTS Services in a number of ways, including:
- directly from you through website purchases, when signing up to the HOYTS Rewards or HOYTS Insider programs, employment applications and phone calls and email correspondence.
-  from third parties including our partners, suppliers and public authorities.
The types of personal information we collect includes:
- your email address, name, address, date of birth and what movies you prefer;
- information about your use of our products and Services in order to customise our Service and make them as interesting as possible for you.
The purposes for which we collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information
(a) Primary purpose for collecting your personal information
Our purpose in collecting this information is to assist us to provide product and service information tailored to your interests and to provide you with a customised experience across the whole range of HOYTS Services. We will also collect information in order for us to be able to assess any employment applications.
(b) Use and disclosure of your personal information
We will use or disclose your personal information for our primary purpose of providing you product and Service information tailored to your interests and to provide you with a customised experience across the whole range of HOYTS Services.

If you wish to opt out of receiving any further marketing or advertising material from us, please email us at http://www.hoyts.com.au/guest_service/contact_us.aspx, or click “unsubscribe” at the bottom of the email messages we send you.
Some advertisements displayed on our website or through the Hoyts mobile app are provided by the specialist company ROKT, and when you order our goods and services on‑line we may provide limited information about you to ROKT so that these can be personalised.  Any information collected by ROKT is subject to its privacy policy (http://rokt.com/blog/privacy-policy/).
From time to time, HOYTS conducts competition on its website.  When we run these competitions, we may also give you the choice of being on a mailing list to receive further contact from us.  Unless you choose to receive further communications from HOYTS, the information we collect from your entry in the competition is not used for any purposes other than for the competition.
(c) To whom do we disclose your personal information?
We provide your personal information to a third party marketing company which aggregates and de-identifies the information and provide us with a report that assists us in marketing the HOYTS Services.  We share these transactional information reports with advertisers to ensure only relevant advertisements are provided to you.
We may also share your personal information with a service partner (such as auditors, lawyers, couriers, computer security companies, hosting services and ROKT) or a company or person related to us, for example, a related body corporate, a common shareholder or someone with whom we share some common commercial interest. To the extent that these service partners, companies or persons are located in Australia and we give them access to your personal information, they are subject to privacy legislation which prevents them from using the information for any other purposes.
We may also disclose your personal information to participating rewards program partners for the following purposes:
Ensuring that you are credited with points earned with rewards program partners;
Ensuring that you are able to redeem points earned with rewards program partners;
To optimise the benefits available to you under rewards program partners; and
To optimise offers from rewards program partners to purchase HOYTS products.
We may also disclose your personal information to our overseas service providers which have servers located in Sweden and the United States of America. We require the overseas service provider to handle your personal information in accordance with Australian privacy principles. We remain committed to safeguarding your personal information.
We will not otherwise use, disclose or share your personal information with a third party without your consent, unless:
- required by the law;
- we believe on reasonable grounds that disclosure is required to prevent or lessen significant risk to the life or physical, mental or emotional health of the consumer or another person;
- we take appropriate action in relation to a reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity, or misconduct of a serious nature, that relates to our functions or activities;
- disclosure is required to assist any entity, body or person to locate a person who has been reported as missing;
- disclosure is made for the purpose of establishing, exercising or defending a legal or equitable claim; or
- disclosure is made for the purposes of a confidential alternative dispute resolution process.
