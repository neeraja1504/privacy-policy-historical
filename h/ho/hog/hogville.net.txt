Privacy Policy – Hogville
Hogville.net has a great tradition of protecting its member’s privacy.  With the fact that we welcome most people to our site, we’ve been graced by the presence of several current and former players, UofA Athletic Administration, current and former coaches, current and former officiating crew members as well as several current and former media members.  As such, we will protect our membership as much as humanely possible.
Your Email Addresses are safe on Hogville!  – We give you the ability to hide yur email address from every other person on Hogville.net, with the exception of Hogville.net’s Administration.  Further, we will not reveal your email address to anyone, for any reasons except the two following caveats:  #1, by specific authorized request from the person affected.  #2, as ordered to do so, under subpoena by a court of law, and with valid reason to do so.  Beyond that, Hogville will not identify you (also sometimes called “outting you”), nor will we sell your email address or allow it to be transmitted to a third party.
Please do be aware that if someone contacts you via the email form on our forums, and you reply back to that person that your email address will be made public to that person.  We urge you to take advantage of our protection that we offer on our forums in order to protect your identity and privacy.
“Outting” someone (such as a player, a parent, etc)  – We respectfully request that if you have the opportunity to publicly identify a player, parent, coach or staff member of the University of Arkansas on our forums that you do not do so.  You are welcome to contact that person, using existing resources on Hogville, however, they are under no obligation to identify themselves nor to respond to you.  If they specifically state that they do not wish to be identified, respect that, please.  Please note that Moderators and Administrators may ask for identifying information if someone chooses to out themselves, for the sake of protecting said person’s identity a bit more.
Posting on Hogville  – Please note that with each post, your IP address is recorded, in the event that you need to be banned from this forum or your ISP contacted. This will only happen in the event of a major violation of this agreement.
Kindly be aware that by even logging in and registering on Hogville, the chances of you being 100% anonymous to Hogville.net Administration is extremely rare.  We have access to resources and utilities that will allow us to locate your physical location, down to within 30 feet.  It would probably be a very good idea for you to ensure that you are following Hogville’s rules.
It is important to note that we will not publicly reveal your information, unless it becomes necessary for us to do so.  Final discretion resides within Hogville.net’s Administrative team.  Please also note that if you continually post copyrighted information on our site, we may furnish the copyright holder with as much information as needed in order to provide them with legal recourse.
Cookies and Hogville  – Also note that the software places a cookie, a text file containing bits of information (such as your username and password), in your browser’s cache. This is ONLY used to keep you logged in/out. The software does not collect or send any other form of information to your computer.
Private Messages  – Time and time again, we field requests about whether your private messages are just that… private.  The short answer is YES, they are private.  There are only three people on Hogville that have direct database access, however, the need to go read a person’s private messages is extremely rare (again, for legal reasons and justification only), and that it is an arduous task for these three people to do so, that it just simply is not worth the time or effort to do that.
