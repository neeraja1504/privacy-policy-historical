6    Newsletter
6.1    General information
You can subscribe to our newsletter, through which we send you information about our current offers, by providing your consent in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 a of the GDPR.
We use a "double opt-in process" when you register for our newsletter. This means that once you have registered your e-mail address, we send you a confirmation e-mail to that e-mail address in which we ask you to confirm that you want us to send newsletters. If you do not confirm registration within 24 hours, your information will be locked and automatically deleted after a month .
We also save the IP addresses you use and the time of registration and confirmation. The purpose of this process is to provide evidence of your registration and to be able to clarify any potential misuse of your personal data, where necessary.
We only require an e-mail address to send newsletters. Once you have confirmed your registration, we save your e-mail address for the purpose of sending newsletters. The legal basis for this is Article 6 Paragraph 1 a of the GDPR.
You do of course have the option of unsubscribing from the newsletter at any time, and withdrawing the consent given with future effect. In order to do so, please click on the unsubscribe button in the newsletter received.
6.2    Newsletter tracking
We wish to point out that we evaluate your user behavior when sending out newsletters. For the purpose of this evaluation, the e-mails sent include "web beacons", also known as "tracking pixels", which are saved on our website. For evaluations, we link the specified data and the web beacons to your e-mail address and an individual ID.
We create a user profile using the data recorded so that we can tailor the newsletter to your individual interests. In doing so, we record when you read our newsletters and which links in them you click on, and from this we draw conclusions about your personal interests. We link this data with actions you carry out on our website.
You can object to this tracking at any time by clicking on the separate link provided in every e-mail. Information is only saved if you have subscribed to newsletters. Once you unsubscribe, we only save data in a purely statistical and anonymous way.
This kind of tracking is also impossible if you have deactivated images in your e-mail program as the default setting. In this case, however, the newsletter will not be fully displayed and you may not be able to use all of the functions. If you activate the images manually, the tracking described above will take place.
