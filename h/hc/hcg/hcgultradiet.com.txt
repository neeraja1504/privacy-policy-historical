Like most standard website servers, we use log files. Log files  track anonymous user information including, but not limited to, Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider ("ISP"), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time  stamp, and number of clicks. This information is tracked in order to analyze trends, administer the Website, track users' movements in the aggregate and gather broad demographic information  for aggregate use. The information tracked via log files is not linked to personally identifiable information except for IP addresses and source URL.  2. Cookies The Website uses "cookies" to assign unique identifiers to your computer. The cookies we use are persistent files that your web browser places on your computer's hard drive. Cookies may be  used to help save information on past activities and other preferences, so that you are not required to reenter information each time that you visit the Website, and to deliver content specific to  your interests.  3.
