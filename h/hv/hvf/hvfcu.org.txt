Hudson Valley Federal Credit Union Privacy Policy Statement
You may print and retain this disclosure for your convenience or you may request a printed copy by going to any of our branches or calling our Information Center at 800.468.3011.
We at HVFCU, and CUSERVE, Inc, are committed to protecting the privacy of each memberâ€™s financial information consistent with state and federal laws. To that end, we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards at all times that comply with federal regulations to guard your non-public personal information while you conduct business via the Internet, ATM networks, wire services, telephone, the U.S. mail, and other means of communication.
Occasionally, we will supply third party vendors with information we collect regarding our members in order to extend offers that may benefit the membership, such as offers of credit, investments, or insurance products. We will not sell, or otherwise provide, member information to telemarketing firms.
The information we may share with these third party vendors may be collected from the following sources: information we receive from you on membership, deposit, and loan account applications (paper and online) or other forms, or information created as a result of you being a member of HVFCU or a customer of CUSERVE, Inc; information about your transactions with us such as your payment history and credit card usage; and information we receive from consumer reporting agencies such as credit history.
We may also disclose non-public information about you to non-affiliated third parties, as permitted or required by law.
We restrict access to non-public information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products and services to you.
If I prefer that you not disclose nonpublic personal information about me to affiliated third parties, I may opt out of those disclosures, that is, I may direct you not to make those disclosures (other than disclosures permitted by law). If I wish to opt out of disclosures to affiliated third parties, I may check the appropriate opt-out selection on the Master Membership Account Application when establishing membership or I may contact you by calling 845.463.3011 or toll-free 800.468.3011.
If you use an Account Aggregation Service, please review our Account Aggregation Disclaimer.
