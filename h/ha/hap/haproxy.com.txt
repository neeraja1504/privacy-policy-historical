Privacy Policy - HAProxy Technologies
Last modified: September 24th, 2018
We at HAProxy Technologies LLC and our affiliated entities (collectively, “HAProxy”) respect your privacy. The website and the data processor of HAProxy comply notably with European provisions on the protection of privacy and personal data, including the 2016/679 European Regulation on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.
We are publishing this version of the HAProxy Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) to disclose our practices and approach to data privacy and data protection.
This Policy describes notably how we collect, use, transfer, and safeguard information about you and your options regarding accessing or modifying such information.
Throughout this Policy we use the terms “Personal Information” and “PII” to describe information that can be associated with a specific natural person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider Personal Information or PII to include information that has been anonymized or aggregated so that it does not identify a specific natural person. If you give us PII on behalf of someone else (or someone else gives us PII on your behalf), the person providing the PII must have consent to do so from the person whose information is being provided to HAProxy.
DATA CONTROLLER
The controller of Personal Information is HAProxy, a Limited liability company located 375 Totten Pond Road, Suite 302, Waltham, MA 02451, United States.
CONSENT
You are informed regarding the Policy during the collection of your PII.
By ticking the box: “ _I have read the privacy policy and agree that my data are collected in accordance with this privacy policy and that I am legally capable of disclosing my personal information”  _you agree that your PII are retained and processed by HAProxy.
HOW WE COLLECT PII
We collect PII from you in the following ways:
We may collect information from you, or someone acting on your behalf, when you interact with the services proposed byHAProxy. For example, you provide PII to us when you:
create accounts for services,
initiate or complete a transaction,

elect to receive marketing or technical communications,
complete a survey,
receive customer support,
purchase, download, or register to use products, or
apply for a job,
meet us in trade shows.
We, including our third party service providers, use certain tools to collect information and PII about you while browsing our website. These tools use cookies which are small text files that are stored on your hard drive. The cookies are used, among other things, to improve website performance, to provide you with customized viewing options, to compile statistical reports on website activity, or for security purposes. We also use cookies to recognize you as a previous visitor of our website, or to pre-populate website forms. Such information may be disclosed to third parties to provide any of the activities mentioned above on behalf of us.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to combine other information as defined above with Personal Information that you submit.

For example, a third party may provide us with your age, gender, or zip code. Information we receive from a third party is subject to your agreement with such third party. We may merge information we receive from third parties with information we have collected or will collect.
Some elements of the services such as events, websites, and offers may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. For example, HAProxy may sponsor a website through which you can simultaneously purchase products and services from multiple HAProxy partners. If you provide PII in these cases, both HAProxy and each company involved in the transaction may receive the information collected in connection with that transaction and thereafter may use the information according to each company’s privacy policy and any other agreement each company may have with you.
