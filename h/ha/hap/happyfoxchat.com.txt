Site Navigational Information: Company uses commonly-used information gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate the Sites about your use of the Sites and Services (“Site Navigational Information”). As described more fully below, Company and its partners use these cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer websites including the Sites and Services, track users’ movements around the Sites and Services, serve targeted advertisements and gather demographic information about the user base as a whole.
Cookies: Company uses cookies to make your interactions with the Sites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of the Sites, Company’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Company, such as by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a “Contact Us” or a “Demo Request” or an account “Sign Up” Web form), or by becoming an Applicant, you remain anonymous to Company. Company uses cookies that are session- based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of the Sites or Services. The following sets out how Company uses different categories of cookies and your options for managing cookies’ settings:
Required Cookies: These cookies enable you to navigate the Sites and use their features, such as accessing secure areas of the Sites and using Services. If you have chosen to identify yourself to Company, Company may place on your browser cookies containing an encrypted, unique identifier. The cookies allow Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Sites and Services and to process your online transactions and requests. The required cookies are essential to operate the Sites and Services and therefore you cannot “opt out” of these cookies.
Performance Cookies: These cookies collect information about how visitors use the Sites and Services, including the pages most often visited and if visitors receive error messages from certain pages. The cookies are only used to improve the function and performance of the Sites and Services. Company periodically engages third parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from individuals who visit the Sites and Services, and to track the performance of Company’s advertisements. Company and Company’s third-party partners may also utilize HTML5 local storage or Flash cookies for these purposes. Flash cookies and HTML local storage are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. For information on how to opt out of performance cookies using your browser settings click here. For information on how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 local storage.
Functionality Cookies: Functionality cookies allow the Sites and Services to remember information you have entered or choices you make (such as your username, language, or your region) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies also enable you to optimize your use of the Sites and Services after logging in. Company uses local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies and HTML5 local storage, to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on the Sites and Services to personalize your visit. For information on how to opt out of functionality cookies using your browser settings click here. Note that opting out may impact the functionality you receive when using the Sites and Services. For information on how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here..
Targeting or Advertising Cookies: Company sometimes uses cookies delivered by third parties to show you ads for the products and services that Company thinks may interest you on any devices you may use and to track the performance of Company’s advertisements. For example, in these cases, cookies remember information such as which browsers have visited the Sites. The information provided to third parties does not include Personal Data, but this information may be associated by Company with Personal Data.
Web Beacons: Company uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors’ usage of the Sites and Services and interaction with emails from Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular website or Service tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a website or Service tied to the Web beacon. For example, Company may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of the Sites. Company also uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Sites, Services and email communications.
Log Files, IP Addresses, URLs and Other Data: As is true of most websites, Company gathers certain information automatically to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer their Sites and Services. This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), device and application identification numbers, your location, your browser type, your Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, the pages and files you viewed, your searches, your operating system and system configuration information, and date/time stamps associated with your usage. Due to Internet communications standards, when you visit or use the Sites and Services, Company automatically receives the URL of the website from which you came and the website to which you go when you leave Company’s Sites. This information is used to analyze overall trends, to help Company improve the Sites and Services, to track and aggregate non-personal information, and to provide the Sites and Services. For example, Company uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which customers and visitors navigate the Sites. Company also collects IP addresses from customers when they log into the Services as part of the “IP Restriction” security feature as well as to maintain audit logs.
Do Not Track Signals: Currently, various browsers — including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. Company does not currently recognize browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Sites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. Company takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.
Mobile Application Data: Company may obtain information collected through applications (“Mobile Applications”) that Customers or their authorized individuals (“Users”) download to and run on their mobile devices (“Device(s)”). Mobile Applications provided by Company may obtain information from, or access data stored on, Users’ Devices to provide services related to the relevant Mobile Application. For example, a Mobile Application may: access a camera on a User’s Device to enable the User to upload photographs to the Services. Information obtained to provide Mobile Application services may include information obtained in preparation for anticipated updates to those services. Mobile Applications may transmit information to and from Devices to provide the Mobile Application services. This also includes User’s Device identification information in order to send push notifications as part of the Services.
Mobile Applications may provide Company with information related to Users’ use of the Mobile Application services, information regarding Users’ computer systems, and information regarding Users’ interaction with Mobile Applications, which Company may use to provide and improve the Mobile Application services. For example, all actions taken in a Mobile Application may be logged, along with associated information (such as the time of day when each action was taken). Company may also share anonymous data about these actions with third party providers of analytics services. In addition, if a User downloads a Company Mobile Application after clicking on a third-party mobile advertisement for the Mobile Application or for Company, the third-party advertiser may provide Company with certain information, such as the User’s Device identification information, which Company may use to track the performance of its advertising campaigns.
Customers may configure Company Mobile Application services, and the information accessed or obtained by the Mobile Application on a User’s Device may be affected by the Customer’s configuration. In addition, if a Customer purchases more than one Service from Company and its affiliates, a Mobile Application may be designed to interoperate with those Services; for instance, to provide a User with access to information from any or all of those Services or to provide information from a User’s Device to any or all of those Services. Information accessed or obtained by the Mobile Application on a User’s Device may be accessible to the Customer and its organization, depending on the intended functionality of the Mobile Application. Company may provide updated versions of its Mobile Applications. If your Device’s settings permit, those updates will be downloaded and installed automatically on the Device. By installing a Company Mobile Application on your Device, you consent to the downloading and updating of that Mobile Application.
In addition to Mobile Applications offered by Company, Company may offer platforms for the creation of third-party Mobile Applications, including but not limited to the HelpStack.io mobile SDK. Third parties may obtain information from, or access data stored on, Users’ Devices to provide services associated with any third-party Mobile Applications that Users download, install, use, or otherwise interact with over a Company platform. Company’s Mobile Applications may also contain links or integrations to other Mobile Applications provided by third parties. Third parties’ use of information collected through third-party Mobile Applications is governed by the privacy policies of such third parties. Company encourages you to review the privacy policies of third-party providers of Mobile Applications to understand their information practices.
Notices and contractual terms related to a particular Mobile Application may be found in the end user license agreement or relevant terms of service for that application. Company encourages you to review the end user license agreement or relevant terms of service related to any Mobile Applications you download, install, use, or otherwise interact with to understand that Mobile Application’s privacy practices.
Customer Data: Customers may electronically submit Personal Data or other information to the Services for hosting and processing purposes (“Customer Data”). For clarity, an "Authorized User(s)" is any individual authorized by a Customer to register a staff / an agent account identified through a unique login as a staff / an agent and/or an administrator; an "End User(s)" is any individual who seeks to interact with a Customer or an Authorized User through the Services. For purposes of the EU Directive on Data Protection (the "Directive"), Company is the data processor and not the data controller. In particular, Customers who control their Customer Data and send the Customer Data to Company's Sites or Services for processing are the "data controllers" of that data and are responsible for complying with the Directive and relevant data protection legislation in the relevant European Economic Area ("EEA") member state before sending Personal Data to Company for processing. Company collects information under the direction of its Customers (the data controller), and has no direct relationship with the Customer’s Authorized Users whose Personal Data it processes. Company stores and processes Customer Data in the United States and EEA and potentially in other countries through third parties that Company uses to operate and manage the Sites and Services. When you access or use the Sites or Services, or otherwise provide information to us, you are consenting on behalf of yourself, Authorized Users, and End Users (and representing that you have the authority to provide such consent) to the processing and transfer of information in and to the United States and other countries which have different privacy laws from the applicable country of residence. Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Customer Data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Company will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such Customer Data except as provided in Company’s standard terms of service (HappyFox helpdesk - https://www.happyfox.com/terms-services/ and HappyFox Chat - https://happyfoxchat.com/terms-services). Company does not own, control, or direct the use of the Customer Data stored or processed through the Services. Company may access Customer Data only for the purpose of providing the Services or preventing or addressing service or technical problems or as may be required by law. Only you or your Authorized Users or your End Users, as applicable, are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such Personal Data or Customer Data.
Personal Data and other information from Third Party Services: Company may also obtain other information, including Personal Data, from third parties and may combine that information with Personal Data and other information that Company collects through its Sites and Services. For example, Company may have access to certain information from a third party social media or authentication service if you log into the Services through such a service or otherwise provide Company with access to information from the service. Any access that Company may have to such information from a third party social media or authentication service is in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by that service. By authorizing Company to connect with a third party service, you authorize Company to access and store your name, email address(es), current city, profile picture URL, and other Personal Data that the third party service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Policy. You should check your privacy settings on these third party services to understand and change the information sent to Company through these services.
