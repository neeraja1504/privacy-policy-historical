AD CHOICES
Cookies and other Tracking Technologies
We use cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, statistical IDs, flash cookies, and similar tracking technologies to collect information about the activities of our visitors and registered user over time and across different Sites, such as the pages a visitor views, the links on which a visitor clicks, how frequently a visitor accesses the Platform, and other visitor attributes and behaviors.  We also collect log file information from a visitor’s browser such as web request, IP address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, and landing pages.  We may use statistical modeling tools to attempt to recognize visitors across multiple devices.
We may retain the services of third party service providers who may link personal information about a visitor – such as name or email address – to other information they may have – for example, past purchases. This information may allow us to identify assumed interests or preferences of that visitor, so that we can provide a visitor with more useful and relevant offers or services.

Gather statistical information about the use of the Platform, to understand how our Platform is used, and improve design and functionality;
Store, on a visitor’s device, information about that visitor’s preferences and settings;

Most browsers contain information on how to control or delete cookies. These settings will typically be found in the “options” or “preferences” menu of a browser.

Please note that blocking or disabling certain cookies may interfere with certain functionalities of some parts of our Platform. Choices you make about cookies are also browser and device specific. Further, while disabling a cookie may prevent the collection of information in the future, it does not prevent the use of information collected before the cookie was disabled.

Analytics
Information collected by Google Analytics is transmitted to, and stored by, Google in accordance with its privacy practices.  To see an overview of privacy at Google and how this applies to Google Analytics, please click here: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245.

Interest-Based Advertising
We may – or may have third parties, on our behalf – display to a visitor interest-based advertising and other custom content regarding our capabilities, products or services that may be of interest to visitors. These advertisements may be served to a visitor on or through our Platform, or on third-party websites. They may be based on interactions that a visitor has had with us or our Platform, on other activities and behaviors that the visitor demonstrates online, assumed interests attributed to that visitor, browsing history, and other information gathered about that visitor over time across multiple sites.
To collect this information, our service providers may place or recognize a unique cookie on the user’s browser and use other techniques, such as pixel tags. If you are using one of our mobile applications, our ad network partners may use and store your mobile device ID or Advertising ID to show ads that they consider relevant to you.
Do Not Track
Some browsers give individuals the ability to choose not to be tracked while browsing on the Internet. The Internet industry has not yet agreed on a definition of what “Do Not Track” means, how compliance with “Do Not Track” would be measured or evaluated, or a common approach to responding to a “Do Not Track” signal. Consequently, due to the lack of guidance, we have not yet developed features that would recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals in response to California law. However, please note the capabilities below.
How to Opt-out of Interest-Based Advertising
You may opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising as explained below. The opt-out may be provided through specific tracking opt-out cookies. Please note that if you get a new computer, install a new browser, or erase or alter your browser’s cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers), this may also clear any opt-out cookie.
To opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from advertising networks that may be delivered on a website, visit the following websites, and follow the instructions:
http://optout.aboutads.info/#/ and http://www.aboutads.info/choices
In addition, some third-party businesses may provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology.  For more information about the opt-out process, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative, you may want to visit:
http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#/  and  http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
Mobile device visitors may also download the AppChoices app at:
www.aboutads.info/appchoices to opt out from interested based advertising served in mobile apps.
The features above will allow a visitor to opt out of many –but not all – of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage.
Data Retention
You can request that we stop using your information to provide you services by contacting us at the address provided in the “How to Contact Us” section.
Information Security
We take reasonable measures to protect any personal information we may hold in order to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. In some areas of our Platforms, we may use Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) or Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) encryption technology to enhance data privacy and help prevent loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control.
We cannot guarantee, however, that all information will remain secure. The Internet by its nature is a public forum. We encourage you to use caution when disclosing information online. Often, you are in the best situation to protect yourself online. You are responsible for protecting your login ID and password from third party access, and for selecting passwords that are secure.
Consent to Transfer of Information
If you are located outside the United States, please be aware that information we collect about you will be transferred for processing to the United States or other countries or jurisdictions that may not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.
By registering for, and using the Platform, you consent to the transfer and storage of your personal information to the U.S. or to any other country in which we or our service providers maintain facilities.
Marketing Choices
Company material is provided at no cost to all visitors.  In order to finance some of the operations of the Platform, we have opted to make it available to advertisements by third parties. We may use aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements targeted to a specific audience. Based upon the aggregated information we have collected about visitors, we display the advertisement to the intended audience based on these general criteria. Some advertisement methodology may be directed to a specific individual, and may be based on the specific apparent interest of the visitor of a specific device.
Electronic Communications
If you receive commercial electronic communications from us, you can unsubscribe from the receipt of future commercial electronic communications from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe link” provided in such communications. Please also note that if you do opt out of receiving emails from us, we may still send you important administrative messages (such as updates about your account or service changes), and you cannot opt out from receiving these messages. Please note that even though you may opt-out of receiving marketing-related Communications from us, we may still send you important administrative messages.
We may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes and/or to complete any transaction that you began before requesting a change or deletion. In addition, it is likely that residual information might remain within our databases, back-ups or other records and might not be removed.

Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, also known as the “Shine the Light Law,” any users of the Platform who are California residents are entitled to request and receive once a year, free of charge, a notice from us describing what categories of customer information (if any) we shared with third parties, including our corporate affiliates, for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.  If applicable, the notice will identify the categories of information that we shared, and the names and addresses of the third parties and affiliates with which we shared your information.
