Protection of Company and Others
We will also share Personal Information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Company if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of your Personal Information is reasonably necessary to detect or protect against fraud or security issues, enforce our terms of use, meet any enforceable government request, defend against legal claims, or protect against harm our legal rights or safety.
How Do We Use Tracking Technologies?
A "cookie" is a small file placed on your hard drive by some of our web pages.   We, or third parties we do business with, may use cookies to help us analyze our web page flow, customize our services, content and advertising, measure promotional effectiveness and promote trust and safety. Cookies are commonly used at most major transactional websites in much the same way we use them in our Services.
You may delete and block all cookies from our Services, but parts of the Services may not work. We want to be open about our cookie use.
Even if you are only browsing the Services, certain information (including computer and connection information, browser type and version, operating system and platform details, and the time of accessing the Services) is automatically collected about you. This information will be collected every time you access the Services and it will be used for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.
You can reduce the information cookies collected from your device.  An easy way of doing this is often to change the settings in your browser. If you do that you should know that (a) your use of the Services may be adversely affected (and possibly entirely prevented), (b) your experience of this and other sites that use cookies to enhance or personalize your experience may be adversely affected, and (c) you may not be presented with advertising that reflects the way that you use our and other sites. You find out how to make these changes to your browser at this site: www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/.  Unless you have adjusted your browser settings so that it will refuse cookies, our system will send cookies as soon as access our Services.  By using the Services you consent to this, unless you change your browser settings.
