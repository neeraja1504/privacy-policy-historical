TUNE Privacy Policy | TUNE
Effective April 26, 2019
TUNE, Inc. (“TUNE”, “we”, “us”, “our”, and formerly known as “HasOffers”) provides a partner marketing platform. This Privacy Policy is provided to help you understand how TUNE processes (i) end user data on behalf of our clients who use the TUNE partner marketing platform, and (ii) your data when you visit TUNE’s corporate family of websites, including tune.com (the “Websites”). It does not state the use practices or policies of our clients, of the websites or apps on which ads are shown, or of other parties.
TUNE cares about how end user data is collected, used, and shared. We are a “data processor” that collects and analyzes end user data at the specific request of our clients, the “data controllers”.
TUNE formerly provided attribution analytics, in-app marketing, and app store analytics services through the TUNE Marketing Console. Provided for historical reference only: please CLICK HERE to access the TUNE Marketing Console privacy policy effective September 2018 (when Branch Metrics, Inc. acquired TUNE’s attribution analytics product).
TUNE Platform and Data Pledge
TUNE is the leading partner marketing platform, used by the world’s top mobile and desktop advertisers and networks to measure and manage their online advertising relationships. Clients use TUNE to assess the effectiveness of their partner relationships and act on those results.
Pursuant to the TUNE Data Pledge, our clients determine the data that they provide to and collect through TUNE. Clients’ use, collection, exportation, or any other use of end user data is governed by their own privacy policies and applicable laws, rules, or regulations.
What Information Does TUNE Collect From Clients?
At the direction of our clients, who act as data controllers, TUNE collects the following types of information from end users to help clients measure and manage their marketing partner relationships:
Ad Identifiers (unique character strings associated with user devices that help monitor and measure user interactions with advertisements and apps, such as Apple’s IDFA and Google Ad ID; Ad Identifiers may be reset by the user)
IP address
Cookies
Pixel tags
Imprecise geographic location data derived from IP address and/or wifi networks
Our clients may also choose to share certain account information for both clients and their partners on the TUNE Platform. This may include corporate and employee information necessary to maintain the services and up-to-date contact information, including: name, mailing and/or billing address, email address, company name, website url, user name, password, and phone number. Clients using TUNE to manage payouts to their partners may also choose to share certain banking information as necessary to carry out the services.
Clients can also choose to view and measure information provided by other third-party sources in the TUNE Platform. Those sources may include advertisers, publishers, marketing partners, and other advertising networks and analytics partners. Marketing partners may sign up with advertisers through the TUNE Platform or through their own customer website. Marketing partner information provided to our advertiser clients may be used by TUNE for fraud prevention purposes and to fulfill contractual requirements with our advertisers.
Clients own the data that they provide to and collect through the TUNE Platform. When clients remove or export their data from the TUNE Platform, their use of data is governed by their own privacy policies and applicable laws, rules, or regulations. TUNE serves as a data processor, acting at the direction of our data controller clients. Specific fields that likely contain personal data, such as IP address or device ID, may be obfuscated or blanked, respectively, by the TUNE client. Additional information on how we categorize and treat data is available here.
What Information Does TUNE Collect On the Websites From End Users?
When you visit the Websites, TUNE collects information about your device and use of the Websites to understand how to improve its Websites. TUNE also collects any information you voluntarily provide when you visit the Websites to learn more about TUNE and its products, sign up for TUNE services, or apply for employment at TUNE. The type of information collected will depend on your request and interaction with the Websites. Categories of information may include specific times of day you accessed the Websites, the IP address of the device you used to access the Websites, the pages on the Websites that you viewed, the pages you visited before navigating to the Website(s), and information about the device you use to access the Websites, including hardware model, operating system and version, and browser.
TUNE uses the information collected on the Websites for various purposes, including:
Ensuring its Websites remain relevant to end user needs and are easy to use by providing analytics and other data regarding use of our Websites.
Sending marketing and promotional communications in compliance with applicable laws.
Enhancing, improving, or modifying its Websites and services, enhancing security, or combating spam or malware or other security risks.
Providing confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and other support and administrative messages.
How Do Clients Use TUNE To Collect Information From Users?
Clients may use TUNE for pixel or server postback tracking to collect certain performance marketing information about end users. Pixel tracking (also called “cookie-based tracking” or “client-side tracking”) methods store a TUNE session identifier in a user’s browser cookie on click. In postback tracking (also called “server-side tracking”), TUNE directly sends a session identifier to the advertiser on click. On conversion, the advertiser then communicates that identifier to TUNE for validation.
TUNE also supports server-to-server measurement for some clients. With any of the mentioned methods, when an end user clicks on an advertisement and goes to a specific web page or mobile app action that a client chooses to measure, TUNE collects information from the user’s device, including but not limited to IP address and ad identifiers.
How May Clients Use TUNE To Process Information From End Users?
Measuring performance of ad campaigns, including creation of customized performance reports
Measuring performance of various marketing partners selected by the client
Serving ads through TUNE using data that does not personally identify users
Managing relationships with marketing partners, including payouts on measured conversions and establishing automated workflows to establishing advertising offers
In Which Instances Might TUNE Share End User Data With Third Parties?
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, TUNE will not share personally identifiable information collected on the Websites or in the TUNE Platform with other people or non-affiliated companies unless we have your consent, or under the following circumstances:
With third party service providers who work for us and need access to your information to do their work on our behalf, such as providing customer support features, processing payments, and storing data (e.g. Amazon Web Services). All such third-party vendors have agreed to protect the confidentiality of information provided by TUNE.
To protect the rights and property of TUNE, our agents, customers, users, and others, including to enforce our agreements, policies, and terms of use.
If required to do so by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or court order, or in the good-faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, prevent fraudulent, malicious, or unlawful activity, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
As part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, or sale of company assets or other event in which information could be transferred to third parties as one of the business assets of the company.
We may also share aggregated or anonymized information in a form that does not directly identify you or any end users with any third parties.
Our Website includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of TUNE. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.
End User Choice, Opt Outs, and Disabling Cookies and Advertising Identifiers
End users can disable cookies in most internet browsers. An overview of the process is available here. Disabling cookies will not, however, stop receipt of all advertisements. If an end user would like to opt out of a particular ad network, publisher, or advertiser’s ads, they will need to contact those companies directly to inquire whether they have an opt-out option.End users can also disable collection of Ad Identifiers for targeted advertising by enabling the Limit Ad Tracking setting on their smartphone. End users can also reset the Ad Identifier altogether using their smartphone’s privacy settings. TUNE collects data on behalf of its business clients, and is not an end user facing company. Nonetheless, TUNE provides end user data rights guidance at https://optoutmobile.com.
