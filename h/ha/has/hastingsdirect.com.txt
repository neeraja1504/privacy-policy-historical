Under Data Protection Law, it's in the public interest for the insurance industry to process information about your health and criminal convictions where it's needed to provide insurance Quotes and insurance services. We ask you to tell us about your health and unspent criminal convictions so we can assess the risk allocated to your policy, such as the validity and extent of potential claims and to detect and prevent fraud.

Additional reasons for processing your data:

We'll tell you about this before we take a payment. You can cancel the continuous payment authority at any time by contacting us.
Surveys
You may be asked to complete a survey or give us feedback on our products and services. Often, we use third parties to carry out these surveys. You don't have to complete them but if you do, we'll use the results to monitor customer service satisfaction and to improve customer service and, where you have given your consent, for marketing purposes.
Call recording
We may record in-bound and out-bound phone calls and use the recordings to prevent fraud, for staff training and for quality-control purposes.
Your use of our website
We use various software including cookies and tags to improve your digital journey and to identify and prevent fraud. We collect and store information about how you access and use our website, app and MyAccount (including the website you visited before coming to our websites). We automatically receive the IP address of your computer, mobile device, or the proxy server you use to access the Internet and this may include information to identify your browser or device to analyse web traffic.
Fraud prevention cookies collect information about certain features of your device, such as your IP address, device type, browser type, screen resolution and operating system. This is to prevent and detect devices associated with fraudulent or other malicious activity and allows us to authenticate your account.
Emails and webchat
We record the sending, delivery, opening and use of any links in emails and webchat and whether you mark an email as junk, including the time and date of these actions. This helps confirm the successful delivery and the use of the emails we send. To help us improve the customer experience, we may record the device the email was viewed on, the web browser used, how long an email was viewed and any pages you are directed to on our websites.
Marketing – communications
If you've given your consent, we might also use your personal data to send you communications that contain marketing of products, services or offers that we think might be of interest to you, such as discounts on related products or incentives (like a prize draw) for completing a survey. You can opt out of these at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email or by changing your preferences in MyAccount.
Whatever you choose, you'll still receive other important information about the product and services you have with us such as:
* Payment information
* Details on how to manage your policy using our online tools
* Information about a claim
* Messages about your renewal.
Marketing profiling
We may use your data to conduct analysis that groups individuals by one or many variables (e.g. age, location) to understand behavioural trends and to target groups of similar individuals who we think may have an interest in our products, services and/or offers. We'll tailor our offers and communications to you based on the results of this profiling.
We'll never provide information about you to companies outside our Group to use for their own marketing purposes.
Industry databases and other sources
We might use information about you from industry-wide databases and other third parties, to help us calculate an insurance Quote, manage a policy and for anti-fraud purposes. Details of the databases we currently use are available on request.
We and our Product Providers may also validate the information you give us when requesting a Quote and if a claim is made on your policy. We do this to identify and prevent crime and fraud to protect the interests of us and our customers. We and our Product Providers may at any time check and/or file your details with fraud prevention agencies and databases if you give us false or inaccurate information and fraud is suspected (see Section 5).
Customer database changes
So we can make sure our customer information is up to date, we'll sometimes use external data partners to provide checks on any changes to customer data or status that we might not have been made aware of otherwise, such as changes of address or deaths.
Price comparison or other introductory services
If you get a Quote through a price comparison website (PCW) or other service, we'll get the information you've given to that service, so we can respond to your request. This is to improve your online experience by not having to re-enter your details.
We also process the information you've given to a PCW and other introductory services to get a Quote (whether you buy the policy or not), to validate later data given by you to us and/or PCWs, to detect fraud, to develop acceptance risk criteria and to build both underwriting (insurer(s)) and retail price models.
Where you've bought a policy using an introductory cash back incentive code or link, we get and share information about you with the incentive provider to validate your cash back claim. See our cookie policy for more details.
Credit searches and data checks
Credit reference agencies collect and maintain information about consumers' and businesses' credit behaviour. This includes the electoral register, fraud data, search history, credit information and public information such as County Court Judgments and bankruptcy orders.
We pass information about you to a credit reference agency, where it's needed to carry out a search on your credit file to identify you, before we, and/or your Product Provider, can give you any services (including Quotes and before offering a renewal). We also ask them to give us your credit score and information about your public credit information, for example County Court Judgments or insolvency, as this information is used in our credit assessment.
The credit reference agency keep a record of the search and place a 'soft footprint' on your credit file, whether or not your application continues. This can only be seen by us, them, and you and won't be used by other organisations to make credit decisions.
We may also carry out an additional credit check to meet legal or regulatory obligations. We'll let you know if we do this. The credit reference agency will keep a record of this check and place a 'hard footprint' on your credit file, whether your application for credit goes ahead or not. The hard footprint may be given to other organisations and used to:
* a) Help calculate credit scores
* b) Help make decisions, such as:
* To confirm your identify
* To check application details
* To assess your eligibility for credit products
* To recover debt.
* c) Detect and prevent crime and fraud
* d) Trace your whereabouts and maintain accurate records.
Claims Underwriting Exchange (CUE) and other registers and databases
We, our Product Providers and other Insurers exchange information with various databases and registers to help us, and our Product Providers check the information you give us, to detect and prevent crime and fraud and to get information about your no claims history. These may include:
* The Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register (CUE), run by Insurance Database Services Limited (IDS Ltd)
* The Hunter Database run by MCL Software Ltd
* The Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, run by the Association of British Insurers (ABI)
* The No Claims History Database, run by RelX Group trading as LexisNexis.
Information may be shared with these registers and checks carried out against the information held on these registers when we and our Product Providers are dealing with:
* Your request for insurance
* Your renewal
* When amendments are made to your motor or home policy
* Where a claim is made
* Where it is necessary to update our policy records.
Under the Terms and Conditions of your policy, you must tell us or, if detailed in your policy, your Product Provider, about any incident (such as an accident, fire or theft) which might cause a claim. When you tell us or our Product Providers about an incident, we, or our Product Providers, will pass this information to the above registers and any other relevant registers.
Fraud prevention agencies
The personal data you've given us, we've collected from you or we've received from third parties will be used to confirm your identity and to identify and prevent fraud and money laundering.
The type of information that will be processed could be your:
* Name
* Address
* Date of birth
* Contact details
* Financial information
* Employment details
* Device identifiers including IP address
* Vehicle details.
We, and fraud prevention agencies, may also allow law enforcement agencies to access and use your personal data to detect, investigate and prevent crime.
We process your personal data on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in preventing fraud and money laundering and to confirm your identity. This is so we can protect our business and comply with laws that apply to us. Such processing is also a contractual requirement of the services or financing you have asked for.
Fraud prevention agencies can hold your personal data for different periods of time and if you're considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your data can be held for up to seven years.
If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine you're a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services and financing you've asked for, or to employ you, or we may stop providing any existing services.
A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be kept by the fraud prevention agencies and may result in others refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you. If you've any questions about this, or for more information on the fraud prevention agencies we share data with or to exercise your data protection rights, you can contact us as explained in Section 8.
MyLicence
Where you tell us your driving licence number (DLN), you're giving permission for us to pass it to the DVLA, so a search can be carried out to confirm your (or any named driver's) licence status, entitlement and relevant restriction information and endorsement/conviction data. The data provided by the DVLA may be used alongside other information you have provided:
* To calculate your motor insurance Quote
* To manage your policy
* For anti-fraud purposes.
Your DLN won't be used for any other reason or be made available to anyone else. Only the motor insurance industry can use this information. If you apply for a Quote with us and decide not to take out the insurance, the data returned from DVLA database will be made anonymous or deleted within 30 days after it was received.
Under our User Agreement with the Motor Insurance Bureau, individual customer representatives don't have access to the data returned by a DLN search and won't be able to discuss issues relating to your DLN with you. In these instances, we suggest checking the information associated with your DLN is correct at www.gov.uk/view-driving-licence
For more details about MyLicence visit www.mylicence.org.uk
Automated decision-making
The nature of insurance is to provide a price for a potential risk (including its potential claim value) based on the probability of it arising. So we can give you the best possible price at a speed expected when getting Quotes on the Internet, we use automated decision-making.
Automated decision-making includes:
* The creation of pricing models and risk acceptance criteria
* The profiling of you, based on the data we collect and hold about you to validate and supplement the data we hold about you and to maintain its accuracy
* The application of the pricing and risk models using data we hold about you, to accept or decline your request for insurance and to calculate the price of your policy
* Assessing your ability to pay the insurance premiums and/or credit
* Assessing the risk of fraud being committed on your policy.
From these checks, your premium, policy terms and credit terms will be determined, or we may not be able to give you insurance or credit.
As described in Section 8, you have the right to express your point of view and to object to an automated decision, and to get human intervention to review it.
To identify and prevent fraud
To protect the interests of our customers, us and our Product Providers, the data you give us when requesting a Quote and if a claim is made on your policy may be validated. To identify and prevent crime and fraud we, your Product Provider and our respective agents may at any time check and/or file your details with fraud prevention agencies and databases (see Section 5). If you give us, or our Product Providers, false or inaccurate information and fraud is suspected, we, or our Product Provider, will record this.
