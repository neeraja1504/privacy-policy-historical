other contact or identifying information that you choose to provide.
Other information you may also provide through your use of the Services includes your product preferences, searches, and browsing activity.
In some cases, we also collect information you provide about others, such as when you refer someone to the Services (including promotions) or when you purchase and ship products to someone. We will use this information to fulfill your requests and will not send communications to your contacts unrelated to your requests, unless they separately consent to receive communications from us.
Please note that this Privacy Policy applies to any information that we collect (or that our service providers collect on our behalf) through your use of the Services. If the Services collect and/or share personal information in a manner that differs from what is described in this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the purposes for which such information will be collected and/or with whom such information will be shared (if applicable), whether via a just-in-time notification at the point of collection or via an alternate notice.
INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY FROM YOU
When you access or use the Services, we and our service providers may also automatically collect information about your visit. For example, when you visit the Site, view our advertisements or emails, or otherwise use or interact with the Services, we collect your computer's Internet Protocol (" IP ") address, and may also collect other unique identifiers (e.g., ad tags), information about your hardware, operating system version, browser type and language, screen resolution, geographic location (country, state, and city level), the URL of the website you visited before navigating to the Services, and other analytics and statistical data regarding  use of the Services (e.g., downloads, number of users, access times, sessions, page views, frequency of use, retention, clicks, etc.). In addition to the above, if you access the Services via a mobile device, we may also collect your device ID, device make and model, and mobile carrier.
To collect this information, we and our service providers use various technologies, including the following:
Cookies: Cookies are small data files stored on your computer or mobile device by a website. Among other things, cookies help us and our service providers to improve the Services, remember your preferences, support security features, see which areas and features of the Services are popular, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, and provide and personalize content and advertising. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, please see the “What are my information choices?" section below.
Clear GIFs: Clear GIFs, sometimes called "web bugs" or "web beacons," are small electronic images that are placed on a web page or in an email message or advertisement.  Clear GIFs may permit us to drop or read cookies, and are often used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser to a particular device. We use clear GIFs to, among other things, collect information, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, provide and personalize content and advertising, and tell if a recipient has opened and acted upon an email.
Log Files: Log files record website activity on the Services and enable us to gather statistics about our users' browsing habits. These entries help Hasbro determine, among other things, how many and how often users have accessed or used the Services, which pages of the Services they've visited, and other similar data.
Do Not Track (DNT) Signals: Your browser may allow you to set a Do Not Track (DNT) signal indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked. Currently, our system does not support and cannot act on DNT signal headers that we may receive. However, the choices that we provide you concerning collection and use of your personal information will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy.
We may also associate the information we collect from these technologies with other information that you provide for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM THIRD PARTIES
We and our service providers may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the Services. For example, if we enable a feature on the Site that permits you to interact with a third-party social networking site, we may have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such third-party social networking site.

SOCIAL SHARING FEATURES
The Services (including content and functionality on or features of the Services provided by our service providers) may offer third party social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook and Twitter widgets), which let you share actions you take on the Services with other media, and vice versa.

6. ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING
WEBSITE ANALYTICS
We use analytics services, such as Google Analytics, and software provided by third parties to help us understand how users access and use the Services. These tools and services use cookies, web beacons and other devices or technologies on the Services to enable them to track traffic data. The data collected typically includes information such as your IP address, your Internet Service Provider, your web browser, the time spent on web pages, and the links clicked and the advertisements viewed on those pages. We use this information to improve the Services and your experience, to see which areas and features of the Services are popular, and for which visitors, and to count visits.
INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING
We work with agencies, ad networks, and other technology services to place ads for our products and services on other websites and online services.  These third parties use cookies, web beacons and other devices or technologies to collect information about your visits to websites and mobile applications, including to the Services. The data is collected through first party cookies and third party cookies and typically includes information such as your IP address, your web browser, web pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and whether you purchased an advertised product. These third parties use this information to track your activities across times and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering advertising and/or content targeted to your interests.
MATCHED ADS
Third party websites and applications may display ads from Hasbro that are targeted to reach people (or people similar to people) on those websites or applications who have visited our Services or are also identified on one of more of Hasbro's databases. This is done by us uploading a customer list to the third party or incorporating a pixel from the third party on our Services, and the third party matching common factors between our data and the data of the third party. For instance, we incorporate the Facebook pixel on our Site and may share your email address with Facebook as part of Facebook Custom Audiences. We may also work with partners to deliver matched ads based on data about you and others in those partners' own databases.
For information about your choices regarding analytics, interest-based advertising, and matched ads, please see the next section.

REGARDING PERSONAL INFORMATION
If, you have created an account with the Services, you may at any time review and/or update the contact details and address information we have for you by signing in, or inform us that you want us to remove your account information from our database by contacting Hasbro Consumer Care. If you choose to send us an email through Consumer Care, please be sure to include the following in your message: the name of the Hasbro website with which you have an account, and the email address you used to sign up for that account so that we can verify your request. If you have requested that we save information for you in connection with placing an order through the Services, please email your request to CustomerService@HasbroPulse.com. We will respond to all access and deletion requests as soon as possible. Please note, however, that we may retain your information following such requests as described in the section on Security below.
REGARDING RATINGS, REVIEWS, AND QUESTIONS YOU POST
If you have posted product-related questions, ratings, or review content that you want us to remove from the Site, please email your request to CustomerService@HasbroPulse.com
REGARDING PROMOTIONAL COMMUNICATIONS
We may send you promotional communications if you sign up to receive them through the Services. If you have signed up to receive promotional communications from Hasbro via another Hasbro ecommerce site, you will continue to receive them through Hasbro Pulse, Hasbro’s latest shopping destination for fans.
You may opt-out of receiving promotional emails or mail from Hasbro by declining to receive such communications when you place an order or at the time you otherwise provide your contact information to us. You may also opt-out of receiving promotional emails at any time by following the instructions to “unsubscribe” in those emails or by sending an email to CustomerService@HasbroPulse.com.
If you opt-out, we may still send you transactional or relationship messages, such as emails about your account, an order you have placed, a crowdfunded product you have backed, or our other ongoing business relations.
REGARDING COOKIES
Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of the Services.
REGARDING ANALYTICS AND INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING
Google provides tools to manage the collection and use of certain information by Google Analytics at tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
Some of the companies we work with to provide you with targeted advertising participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") or the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). For more information about the targeted advertising provided by these companies, and how to opt out of having your information used in this way by these companies, please visit: www.aboutads.info/choices for opt out for DAA participating companies or www.networkadvertising.org/choices for opt out for NAI participating companies . Opting out only means that the selected participants should no longer deliver certain targeted ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks).
To opt out of us using your data for matched ads, please contact us as set forth in the “Contact Us” section below and specify that you wish to opt out of matched ads. We will request that the applicable third party not serve you matched ads based on information we provide to it. Alternatively, you may contact the applicable third party to opt-out.
You may also limit our use of information collected from or about your mobile device for purposes of serving online behavioral advertising to you by going to your device settings and selecting “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices) or “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” (for Android devices).
Please note that if you opt out using any of these methods, the opt out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt out. Hasbro is not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any opt out options or programs, or the accuracy of any third party statements regarding opt out options or programs.
8. SECURITY
Hasbro has established policies in an effort to protect your personal information against loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and/or destruction. For example, Hasbro strives to provide only those employees performing a legitimate business function with access to users' personal information. Hasbro also reviews its security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods.
Hasbro retains your information for business purposes, for as long as your account is active, and/or as long as is reasonably necessary to provide you with our products and services. Hasbro will also retain your information as reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. We may also retain cached or archived copies of your information for a reasonable period of time.
Despite our efforts, please be aware that no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable. To that end, Hasbro will notify users of a data breach when Hasbro determines that is reasonably necessary in accordance with applicable law.
