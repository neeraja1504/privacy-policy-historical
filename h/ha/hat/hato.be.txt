How Hato Responds To Civil Investigations?
Hato will not sell or otherwise release a member's identifying information - minimal information reasonably calculated to identify and no more - or usage information to investigators, attorneys, or agencies unless we are directed to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction in the matter. If there is a hearing in court, the member will be notified so they will have an opportunity to contest the surrender of personal information.

Hato cooperates fully with law enforcement agencies, yet there must still be a subpoena before Hato provides a member's identifying information - minimal information reasonably calculated to identify and no more. In a criminal investigation Hato is required by the Law to not divulge the fact of the investigation to the member.
