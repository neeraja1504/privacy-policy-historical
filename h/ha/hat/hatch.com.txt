It is Hatch’s policy to obtain your written consent before it uses personal information for a purpose or in a manner different to the purpose or manner that was disclosed to you. However Hatch may collect and provide statistics about the web site and its users to other third parties. To assist us in providing a quality service to you and to evaluate our website a "cookie" (a data file that may be written to your computer by a web site) may be used.

We take all reasonable security measures to protect personal information from loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification or disclosure. As far as permissible under law, you acknowledge that Hatch accepts no responsibility for the unauthorized access of personal information held by Hatch. You can also play an important role in keeping your information secure by maintaining the confidentiality of any password and login details used on this site.
