Privacy Policy - OneLouder Apps
OneLouder Apps Inc., a subsidiary of Pinsight Media+, Inc., ("OneLouder", "we", "us" or "our") respects your privacy and recognizes the importance of protecting information collected about or from you. This Privacy Policy defines how OneLouder collects and uses personal and non-personal information on our website located at OneLouder.com (the "Website") and via OneLouder Applications (the "Applications"). Our applications may also have application-specific privacy policies, which also govern your use of those applications.
OneLouder reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at reasonable times, so please review it frequently. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we collect about you and, where applicable, your account.
PRIVACY PRACTICES FOR THE WEBSITE
What Information is Collected and How is it Used?
The Website does not collect or use any personal data that may be used to identify, track, or contact you, unless you have intentionally provided it ("User-Provided Information"). You can choose not to provide certain information, but please realize you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. Personal data includes things such as your email address and contact information; it does not include information that is not used to identify you, including aggregate or anonymous information.
We do receive and store certain types of automatically collected information whenever you interact with us ("Automatically collected Data"). As with many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses OneLouder.com and our affiliated sites. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide a personalized experience. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookie(s). Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience and some features may be unavailable to you on the Website if we cannot recognize you or if you block or restrict cookies, we want you to be aware that these cookie management tools exist.
We may use tools or third-party analytical software to collect and use certain non-personal data. The types of non-personal data we may collect and use include, but are not limited to: the type of mobile device you use, the location of your device, your mobile deviceâ€™s unique device ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, Wi-Fi mac address, the type of mobile internet browsers you use and information about the ways you use our products and services.
We reserve the right to use and disclose the collected non-personal data in an anonymized and obfuscated way for purposes of advertisement by us or our partners. We take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that we do not pass any personally identifiable information to ad networks or advertisers.
We share your information with third parties generally in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We may disclose both User-Provided and Automatically Collected Information:
as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
with our trusted services providers who work on our behalf, do not have any independent use of the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy policy;
Business Transfers
Personal information about you may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, or sale of company assets. In the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, personal information may also be transferred as a business asset.
Targeted Advertising
We may engage in interest-based or other targeted advertising, including advertising based on your cross-site web viewing data or application use.
We work with Pinsight Media, a mobile ad network that collects data through our applications for purposes of delivering advertising. To find out more about how Pinsight Media collects and uses information about your application use, visit http://pinsightmedia.com/privacy.
We also work with advertisers and advertising networks that serve ads on our site and other websites. These companies may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of our sites and other websites. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on other websites and better understand your online activity.

Please note that your access to OneLouder products and services may be subject to certain third party terms and conditions and privacy policies, including but not limited to application stores, mobile software platforms, on-line gaming platforms and payment providers. You recognize and agree that OneLouder is not liable for any such third party terms and conditions nor their use of your personal data.
Links to Third Party Sites
The Website may at its discretion make available links through advertisements or otherwise enable you to access non-affiliated third party sites or applications. Please note that, while using such sites, you are using properties administered by people or companies not affiliated with or controlled by OneLouder and that are not subject to this Privacy Policy. OneLouder is not responsible for the actions of those people or companies, the content of their sites or games, the use of information you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer. Our link to those sites does not constitute our sponsorship of, affiliation with, or endorsement of a non-affiliated third party site or application.
Children
OneLouder does not sell products for purchase by children. We do not use the Website to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@onelouder.com. We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.
Security
We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Websites and applications. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.
