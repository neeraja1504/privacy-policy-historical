Information We Collect by Automated Means
When you visit our Site, we or our service providers may collect certain information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, Web server logs, JavaScript and Web beacons.
Cookies are small text files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Site. Hannaford does not control browser tools and cannot warrant their effectiveness.
In conjunction with the gathering of information through cookies, our Web servers may log information such as your operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. The Web server logs also may record information such as the address of the Web page that referred you to our Site and the IP address or other identifier for the device you use to connect to the Internet. They may also log information about your interaction with this Site, such as which pages you visit.
To control which Web servers collect information by automated means, we may place tags on our Web pages called “Web beacons,” which are small files that link Web pages to particular Web servers and their cookies.
We may use third-party web analytics services on our Site, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use cookies and web beacons to help us analyze how users use the Site. The information collected by the cookies and Web beacons (including your IP address) will be disclosed to these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Site. To learn more about Google Analytics and how to opt out, please visit https://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/learn/privacy.html.

Third-Party Apps, Tools, Widgets and Plug-Ins
The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on the Site, such as the Facebook and Twitter Share buttons, also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This information is collected directly by the providers of the features and is subject to the privacy policies or notices of these providers. Hannaford is not responsible for these providers' information practices.
Online Tracking
On the Site, we may collect information about your online activities for use in providing you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. This section of our Privacy Policy provides details and explains how to exercise your choices.
You may see certain ads on other websites based on your visits to our Site because we participate in advertising networks administered by third-party vendors. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users' inferred interests and browsing context. These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web beacons and web server logs. The networks use this information to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests. The information our ad network vendors collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the vendors' advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our Site and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. To learn more about how to opt out of ad network interest-based advertising, click here or here.
This Site is not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from browsers.
We do not disclose personal information we obtain about you, except as described in this Privacy Policy. We may share personal information we collect on this website with our subsidiaries and affiliates for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
We may also share personal information with service providers who perform services on our behalf (such as printing or mailing) if they need this information to perform their services. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We may share personal information we collect on this Site at your request. For example, if you purchase a gift card and ask us to send it to a third party, we may identify you as the sender of the gift card.
We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. We reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy.

Links to Other Sites
This Site may provide links to other sites for your convenience and information. These websites may be operated by companies not affiliated with us.

This Privacy Policy does not include Hannaford pharmacy records, which are subject to the Notice of Privacy Practices for Pharmacies, which can be found on the Pharmacy page. Information that is not linked to an individual is not personal information and is not subject to this policy. For example, aggregated or de-identified sales information and transaction data may be shared with others. Since that data is not linked to an individual, it is not protected by this policy.
