Information Security
Wherever your personal information may be held by TSS or on its behalf, TSS intends to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the personal information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. TSS uses reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of all data, not just personal information. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal information. Only those who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve TSS's services have the information. They are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
Site Security
The Site has physical, administrative and technical measures in place to maintain the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the data under our control, and to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of such data. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the appropriate use of all data. While TSS strives to protect your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure and therefore we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you send to us. You send any information via the site at your own risk and are solely responsible for protecting passwords, limiting access on devices, and signing out of websites after your sessions.
International transfer of information collected
TSS is a global organization headquartered in the United States, and consequently your Personal Data may be collected, transferred and stored by us in the United States and by affiliates in other countries that we operate within.
Your Personal Data may be processed outside of the EEA, and in countries which are not subject to adequacy decision by the European Commission and which may not provide the same level of data protection in the EEA. If this is to be the case, Total Server Solutions will ensure that such recipient offers an adequate level of protection, for example by entering standard contractual clauses for data transfer approved by the European Commission or by relying on certification schemes such as the EU - US Privacy Shield scheme.
You have a right to contact us at dpo@totalserversolutions.com for more information about the safeguards we have put in place (including a copy of relevant contractual commitments) to ensure the adequate protection of your personal information when this is transferred as mentioned above.
In limited circumstances, transfers of your personal information may be based on context specific derogations which permit transfers in the absence of safeguards, such as where a transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
Changes to Policy
Please note that this policy may change from time to time. TSS will not materially reduce your rights with respect to treatment of personal information under this policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, TSS will post any policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, TSS will take reasonable steps, whether by e-mail, posting on the Site home page for a reasonable period of time or otherwise, to notify you of such changes. We will also modify the “effective date” atop this policy when changes go into effect. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about the collection, processing, sharing and security of your Personal Data.
Enforcement
When TSS receives formal written complaints (whether by e-mail through this Site or otherwise), it is TSS's policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. This policy and the statements outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
