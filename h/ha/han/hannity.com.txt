1. INFORMATION COLLECTED ON OUR PLATFORMS
Information You Provide To Us
When you use the Platforms, for example to register to create an account, update your information, sign up for a subscription, use certain features, access or download content, purchase items or enter into promotions, refer others to the Platform, interact with us via third-party applications or social media sites, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us, we or our service providers or business partners may collect information that identifies you, including personal information ,  such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, mobile phone number, credit card or debit card details, geographic location, mailing address, date of birth, demographic information (such as zip code, age and gender), photos, videos, social media account details and other information from your device.
You may decide to provide us with another person’s email or phone number so that person may be invited to join iHeartMedia or so that we may facilitate your communication with other people through the service. Local law may require you to seek the consent of your contacts to provide their personal information to iHeartMedia, who may use that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
You may choose to create a personal iHeartRadio Code by enabling this feature through the settings in the App. The iHeartRadio Code is connected to a unique identifier that ties back to your iHeartRadio account and the information associated with your account (e.g., email, year of birth, gender). The iHeartRadio Code can be scanned to enter iHeartMedia contests, access events, and other exclusive promotions and to interact with our Services. We may use the iHeartRadio Code for our administering our contests, promotions, events and for advertising, marketing and related business purposes. We may share the iHeartRadio Code and the associated unique identifier (and underlying account data as well as your name and phone number), with third parties, including our business partners for marketing purposes and as set forth in the applicable sections of our Privacy Policy governing the use and sharing of such data.
Information Collected Automatically
Whenever you visit or interact with the Platforms, we, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Platforms are accessed and used (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include information collected in the following ways:
Log Files:  Information is logged about your use of the Platforms, including your browser type, operating system, activations, content you purchase, access, or download, listening times, the page served and the preceding page views. This statistical usage data provides us with information about the use of the Platforms, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Platforms, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. It also provides us with information about your interactions with songs, playlists, audiovisual content and other iHeartMedia users, as well as advertising and products or services offered through or linked from the Platforms. This information helps us keep our Platforms fresh and interesting to our visitors and enables content to be tailored on and off the Platforms to a visitor’s interests.
Device Identifiers:  We or our service providers and partners may automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for the computer, mobile device, tablet or other device (“Device”) you use to access the Platforms, including the hardware model and mobile network information. A Device Identifier is a number such as a mobile advertising identifier (Android AAID or Apple IDFA) that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a website or its servers or an application, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. We may use and share with third parties Device Identifiers to, among other things, administer the Platforms, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, provide attribution metrics to our advertisers and partners, track users’ web page movements, help identify you and your shopping cart, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
Location Information:  We may collect or infer information about the general location of your Device when you access or use the Platforms; or if you choose to turn on your Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or other geolocation functionality when you use the App, subject to your consent, the App may collect, infer, and use more precise geolocation information. We may use and share your location with certain third-parties for analytics, attribution and advertising purposes (currently advertising use is restricted to iHeartMedia properties only).
Cookies; Pixel Tags:  The technologies used on the Platforms to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, include but are not limited to: cookies (data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Platforms), mobile analytics software and pixel tags (transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed). Cookies may also be used to associate you with social networking sites and, if you so choose, enable interaction between your activities on the Platforms and your activities on such social networking sites. We, or our vendors and partners, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Platforms or third-party sites (such as to select which ads or offers are most likely to appeal to you, based on your browsing behavior, interests, preferences, location, or demographic information), as well as for market research related purposes. Personalized content may also include content from the providers of goods and services that you may be able to purchase through the Platform or otherwise (who may pay us to show you such content). Note, however, that if a third party content provider asks us to show content to users with certain characteristics (for example, women ages 18-24) or a segment of that group (for example, women ages 18-24 who are located in a particular locality) and you respond to that content or click on links embedded in that content, the third-party content provider may conclude that you have the characteristics of the audience that they are trying to reach. iHeartMedia does not have access to or control over cookies, web beacons, or other technologies that third parties who have asked us to show you content may use, and the privacy practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Please contact these companies directly for information on their data collection and privacy practices. For more information on advertising using cookies and how to opt out of advertising cookies specifically, please see the sections on Advertising Services; and Your Privacy Rights, Choices, Access below.
Similarly, we may use analytics platforms and other tracking technologies to help us track and analyze usage of our Platforms, using cookies, pixels and other tracking technologies.
Information Received from Other Sources
We may obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the Platforms. For example, if you create an account using your credentials from a third-party social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, profile and account information, such as lists of your friends, “likes”, comments you have shared, groups and location, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such third-party social media site. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on our Platforms to your profile page to share with others within your network. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party application or website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections'” web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party website or interactive service.
You may integrate your iHeartMedia account with third party applications and sites. If you do, we may receive similar information related to your interactions with the iHeartMedia service on the third party application, as well as information about your publicly available activity on the third party application or site.
We may also receive information about you from our partners and service providers, (including, for example, business partners, analytics vendors, advertising networks and search information providers) which we use to personalize your iHeartMedia experience, to measure ad quality and responses, and to display ads that are more likely to be relevant to you.

Likewise, if you log into a third party application with your iHeartMedia account, that third party application may have access to certain information such as your iHeartMedia playlists and activity. A third party platform’s use of information collected from you (or as authorized by you) is governed by the third party platform’s privacy policies and your settings on the relevant service.

Cookies, Tracking & IBA:
To learn how you may be able to reduce the number of cookies you receive from us or third parties, or delete cookies that have already been installed in your browser’s cookie folder, please refer to your browser’s help menu or other instructions related to your browser to see if you can reject or disable such cookies. You can also learn more about cookies by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browser. Removing or rejecting browser cookies does not necessarily affect third-party flash cookies used in connection with our Platform. To delete or disable flash cookies, please visit https://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html for more information. If you do disable or opt out of receiving cookies, please be aware that some features and services on our Platform may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your account(s). In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.
As described above, we, or other parties we do business with, may place or recognize unique cookies or other technologies on your browser and Device when you visit our Platform to collect information about your use of our Platforms and your other online activities over time and across different websites and apps, and may use that information to serve interest-based advertisements to you as you browse the Internet. To learn more about such interest-based advertising, please visit: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.
There are 2 ways that you can opt out of IBA practices from certain iHeartmedia or third party ads on our Platforms and on third party sites and apps. One way is through the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). To opt out of IBA, please click on the following link and follow the instructions: DAA AppChoices – http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices/ and http://optout.aboutads.info.

Another way to opt out of IBA is by clicking on the Advertising Options Icon featured on certain iHeartMedia ads on third-party websites. When clicked it (i) describes the collection and uses of data gathered at the relevant third-party website and (ii) provides a way for you to opt out of data collection and use by the third parties listed for the purposes of IBA. If you choose to opt out, our service provider will communicate your opt out election to the relevant third-party advertising partners and a cookie will be placed on your browser indicating your decision to opt out.
Bear in mind that because cookies are stored by your browser, if you use different browsers on your computer, or multiple computers and Devices that have browsers and you do not wish to have cookies collect information for IBA purposes, you will need to opt out of IBA from each browser on each of the computers and Devices that you use. Please note that even if you opt out of IBA, you may still receive advertisements from us; they just won’t be customized based on your web-browsing activities on third-party websites. Please also note that if you opt-out of IBA, we may still track your visits to the Platforms for our own analytics, operations and security purposes.
To learn how to change your Device Identifier, please refer to your device’s help menu or other instructions.
