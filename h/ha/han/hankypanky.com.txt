We maintain a record of your product interests and the purchases you make online or by phone. We may combine all of this information with information about you that we acquire from our joint marketing partners, from unrelated third parties, and from our other brands, if any. We also collect and store the Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses of individuals that visit our site.

We do not share our e-mail list with any third parties other than third parties that provide email distribution, digital marketing, and other services on our behalf, and only if such service provider keeps this information confidential and uses it only to provide the applicable services. Each e-mail you receive will give you the option to unsubscribe. If you do not wish to receive marketing emails from Hanky Panky, or prefer that we not share your email address with third parties providing services on our behalf, you may unsubscribe in the manner described below under “Marketing email communications.” We may have to release information (which could include contents of e-mail communications between any persons) in the unlikely event of a legal requirement on us or pursuant to a court order. In addition, we may divulge personal information if we or any of our service providers or consultants believe that such disclosure is necessary to address any unlawful acts or acts that may endanger the health or safety of another customers or of the general public.
When you place an order on any of our website, we use this information to process and track your order and contact you via email, postal mail or phone if we have any questions or concerns regarding your order.

Use of Cookies, Pixel Tags/Clear GIFs/Web Beacons
A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your hard drive. A cookie may contain information (such as unique user ID), which is used to track the pages of the sites you’ve visited. Hanky Panky uses cookies to preserve the contents of your shopping bag between your visits as well as to measure activity on the site which allows us to determine which areas and features of the site are most popular.  Also, third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your past visits to our websites.  ( See  "Customized advertising (behavioral marketing)" above.)  You can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you turn off cookies or refuse them, though, you will not be able to make a purchase from the site, nor will we be able to recognize you as a registered user to allow you access to your account information.
A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our site but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.
Notice to P3P Users
The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P) is a standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3W) that provides an automated, machine-readable mechanism for understanding the use of your Personal Information by the websites you visit. P3P uses a standardized set of multiple choice questions covering the major elements of a website’s privacy policy to provide a cross-section of how the particular website handles the personally identifiable information of its users. P3P-enabled browsers can automatically read this set of preferences made available by P3P-enabled websites and compare this information to the user’s own set of privacy preferences.
Protecting your order information is a priority for us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information.
Accessing our web site from outside the U.S.
If you are visiting hankypanky.com from a location outside the United States, you will be connected through and to servers located within the United States. We currently accept online orders only from customers in the United States. By providing your information to us, you agree that all personal information will be used in accordance with this privacy policy and pursuant to U.S. law.
We may update our privacy policy from time to time. Whenever we make a change, we will post the updated policy at this site and we encourage you to check our policy periodically. If we make a material change to our privacy policy that would lessen your privacy rights, we will either continue to honor our prior policy for information that we collected when it was in force, or we will ask for your consent to the change. If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, please contact us:
• By email: contact-us@hankypanky.com
• By phone: 1.877.447.4811, Monday-Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m EST
• By mail: Hanky Panky Ltd., 373 Park Avenue South – 12th floor, New York, NY 10016
In no event shall Hanky Panky or any of their affiliated entities or suppliers be liable for any indirect, special, punitive, incidental, exemplary or consequential damages even if these entities have been previously advised of the possibility of such damages, whether in an action, under contract, negligence or any other theory, arising out of or in connection with the use, inability to use or performance of the information, services, products and materials available from the site. These limitations shall apply not withstanding any failure of essential purpose or the existence of any limited remedy. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitations may not apply to you.
No transaction of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of Hanky Panky to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your personal information, neither Hanky Panky nor any of our service providers can ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the internet. Any such transmission is done at your own risk.
