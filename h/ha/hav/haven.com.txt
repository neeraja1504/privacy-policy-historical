Privacy policy | Haven
Privacy policy summary
Here at Haven, we always try to go above and beyond to give our guests a great experience.
When planning a break with us, we do our best to make sure that you have all the information needed to find your perfect holiday. To help us do this, we need to ask for a little personal information from you. We'll either ask you for personal information directly or, with your permission, gather it by tracking how you use our website. When we do share your personal information, it's always so we can provide you with an experience that is tailored for you.
Where we have your permission, we plan to send you Haven updates that we think will interest you, whether it be exclusive booking offers or new updates from our holiday parks. We'll also collect technical information, which helps us make sure our website is working at its best, so you can have a smooth experience when browsing. We will occasionally share information with third parties (such as business partners and service providers) so we can give you the best possible service.
If you're going on a break with us, we'll ask you to tell us a little more about yourself, including any health conditions. We only do this so we can plan your break around any special requirements you might have.
We keep your personal information safe and secure, and only hold onto it for a limited time. If you'd like to stop receiving our email marketing and offers, you can click 'unsubscribe' at any time.
Please reach out to us, by emailing privacy@Haven.com, if you have any questions, concerns or feedback on our privacy policy or your personal information.
If you have any comments regarding this privacy policy or the way we handle your personal information, you can also contact the UK Information Commissioner on telephone number 0303 123 1113 or by visiting https://ico.org.uk/.
From time to time, we might review our privacy policy and make changes to it. If we do this, we'll always highlight it on our website and, where appropriate, let you know by email.
