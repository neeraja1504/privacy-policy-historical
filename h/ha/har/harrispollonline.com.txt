A. WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Information you give us. During the recruitment process, the panel registration process, or as part of a research study or survey, you provide us with information. This may include:
“Personal identifying information,” which means information by itself – like your first and last name, home postal address or personal email address – or in combination with other information, that could identify a specific individual.
Demographic information such as gender, marital status, occupation and other information.
Information in connection with your participation in surveys and/or studies. These surveys request additional information such as your behaviors and preferences and help us better understand consumer behavior, use, and trends.
Any content or material you choose to submit, upload or transmit, including without limitation, photos, videos, images, or the likeness of the individual submitting the content in connection with your participation in market research activities.
You may be offered the opportunity to participate in market research activities through a third party service such as Facebook or Twitter. If you select such option, we may collect certain profile information stored in your social media platform account.
In addition to the above mentioned information, through certain surveys or studies, you may be asked to voluntarily provide or disclose Sensitive Information. “Sensitive information” means personal identifying information that discloses or reveals health or medical conditions, sexual orientation or sexual life, political opinions/views, race/ethnic origin, religious and philosophical beliefs and trade-union membership.
If you download our application software onto your mobile device, we will also receive data through the application, such as when you voluntarily provide us with access to the location of your device and activate hardware functions like your camera.
Information collected from your use of our Site and software. When you use our Site or any of our software, and participate in market research activities, we may collect information about your device, system and network. This includes information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the type of browser you are using, the date and time of your visit, the web page you have visited immediately prior to visiting this Site, device identifier, device model, operating system, and language set. For information about cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs or other digital technologies that may be used in connection with your participation, please see section F on Cookies and Other Digital Technologies .
You may also be invited to participate in certain research studies or surveys that ask you to download software, and/or interact with other companies, websites or applications. In the event that additional information is collected, it will be disclosed to you prior to, or at the time of initial collection. You may also be asked to accept other terms in connection with your participation.
Information we get from other sources. After you agree to participate in our market research activities, **** we may receive additional information about you from other sources, including other Nielsen measurement products. This may include information such as what you watch or buy, and your exposure to advertising. We obtain this information from many sources, including outside sources. These include, for example:
census data,
the manufacturers and sellers of the products you purchase or use,
“loyalty” programs (like those that offer rewards and points),
organizations that collect online data,
data suppliers,
companies that combine purchase information, and
other entities that have a legal right to provide such information to us.
We may combine the information you provide with information from these additional sources. We will use the combined information only for the purposes described in this Notice. By participating in our market research, you agree that we may obtain this information about you and combine it in these ways.
B. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US
We use the information we collect to create a variety of research insights for our clients. In research in which the participants are intended to remain anonymous, we use tools and methods to make sure that there is no reasonable possibility of identifying an individual participant in the reports that we create for our clients. For example, we combine the responses we collect from you with the responses of others to produce “aggregated” reports. We also create scientific reports based upon modeled information. “Modeled information” is data we have developed based upon demographic and behavioral characteristics (like your gender, age, and purchasing habits) to predict what people with similar or matching characteristics would buy. For instance, this allows advertisers to identify the likely audience for a marketing campaign.
Our research insights help our clients make choices about where and how they advertise, including on print, broadcast television, radio, online and mobile. Among other things, our solutions have helped clients:
* understand the makeup of the audience that was shown an advertisement while surfing the internet or interacting with social media
*  identify the types of products consumers in different demographic groups would be likely to buy
* determine the audience that would be more likely to respond to a particular advertisement online, on a smartphone, or tablet
* whether residents in a particular neighborhood would be likely to shop at a specialty store if it was nearby
* understand the media and purchasing habits of different types of potential voters
We may use the information you give us to contact you. When we contact you – by phone, email, SMS, or postal mail depending on what information you provide to us – we will usually do so for one of the following reasons:
to respond to your inquiries;
to validate answers you gave;
to update our records to ensure your information is correct;
to ensure that the software is working properly;
to send you information regarding your participation such as how to redeem awards;
to provide a statement regarding changes to our terms, conditions, and policies;
to tailor survey opportunities to you; or
to offer you additional research opportunities through studies and surveys.
If you provide your phone number, you agree that we may call you, and for efficiency and accuracy, you agree that we may use an automatic telephone dialing system or prerecorded voice to do so. You also agree to receive “push” notifications through our software and to be contacted as described above.
We may also use the information for business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products, enhancing our Site or software, improving our services, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of our communications.
If we combine non-personal information with personal identifying information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal identifying information as long as it is combined.
C. WHEN WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
We may share your personal identifying information:
With other members of the Nielsen family of companies for the purposes described in this Notice.
With third parties who provide services for us such as website application hosting; data analysis; infrastructure provision; IT services; email delivery service; credit card processing; auditing services; and reward, incentive, sweepstakes, and other similar services.
With other companies for the purposes of data processing or market research product development purposes. These companies are contractually required to keep this information confidential and secure and are not permitted to use this information for any other purpose except to carry out the services that they are performing for us.
To other companies, including clients, in accordance with market research guidelines. If any such company receives your personal identifying information (whether provided by us to such company or collected by such company directly from you), such company will be bound to keep the information confidential and secure and use it only for research or statistical purposes.
To identify you to anyone to whom you send messages through the Site.
In other ways for which we provide specific notice prior to, or at the time of initial collection.
