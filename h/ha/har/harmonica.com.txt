Cookies
**
A cookie is a message that the server for our Web site gives to your Web browser. Your browser stores the message in a file called cookie.txt. Each time the browser requests a page from the server, a message is sent back to the server. Purposes for cookies include identifying users and preparing customized Web pages for them. When you fill out a form on our site, this information is packaged into a cookie and sent to your browser. It’s stored for later use. The next time you visit our site, your browser will send the cookie to the server, which can use the information to present you with a more personalized experience. For instance, the site may greet you by your name or remember your username when you begin to fill out a form.
If you reject the cookie, you may still use our site; however, you may only receive limited information in some areas of the site.
Some of our business partners, such as advertisers, use cookies on our site. We have no access to these cookies or control over them.

Log Files

We use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track a user’s movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. "Aggregate use" means that information from all users is collected and gathered into a whole unit so that information as a whole can be used. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information.

We offer you the option to discontinue receiving these communications by "opting out" of receiving promotional offers and material.

Supplemental Information
**
In order for us to tailor our site to your individual tastes and preferences, we combine information about the interests and purchasing habits of users with similar information from our partners to create a personalized user profile. Our partners are Amazon.com and MusiciansFriend.com. When you make a purchase from either of these two companies, the company may collect and share that purchase information with us so we may tailor our site to your preferences.
**
Information Use
**
Harmonica.com LLC is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not share, sell or rent this information to others in any way other than as disclosed in this policy or stated at the point where the information is collected.
**
Sharing
**
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
We use a credit card processing company to bill for goods and services and an outside shipping company to ship orders. These companies do not use, share, retain or store personally identifiable information for any purposes other than to process the transaction or to ship the order.
We partner with other companies and individuals to provide specific services. When you sign up for these services, we will share your name or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.
**
Your Choice to Opt-Out
**
You have the opportunity to "opt-out" of having your information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask you for the information. For example, our order form has an opt-out box. If you want to buy a product from us, but you do not want to receive future promotional e-mails or marketing material, you simply check the box to opt-out of the group receiving such e-mails.
We notify you when your information is being collected by any outside parties. You may then make an informed choice as to whether or not you would like to continue receiving services that require an outside party.
**
Correcting and Updating Personal Information
**
If any of your personally identifiable information changes or if you no longer wish to use our service, we will offer you a way to correct, update or remove your personal data that you have provided to us. Usually this can be done on the member information page or by e-mailing us at support@harmonica.com.
**
Security
**
We want to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information on our Web site, your information is protected online and off-line.
When you provide sensitive information on our site (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and protected with encryption software. While you are on a secure page, such as our order form page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked.
While we use encryption software to protect sensitive information online, we also use our best efforts to protect your information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (such as our billing clerk or customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen savers when they leave their desk. The servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
If you have any questions about the security for our Web site, please e-mail us at security@harmonica.com.

This Web site contains links to other Web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of the other sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

Notification of Changes
**
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Home Page so you will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you by e-mail. You will have the choice to allow us to use the information in this different manner. We will use information according to the privacy policy posted at the time the information was collected.
