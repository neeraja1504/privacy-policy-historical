Cookies
It's important to us that your experience with a Harris Web site is effective and satisfying. To accomplish this, we use "cookies" as part of our interaction with your browsers. A "cookie" is a small text file placed on your hard drive by our Web Page Server so it can be read back later from that browser. This is useful for having the browser remember specific information, such as pass codes and log in identification. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or collect personally identifiable information to determine who you are, or capture your e-mail address. The use of cookies is an industry standard - you'll find them almost everywhere on the Internet.
One of the most beneficial uses of cookies is site personalization, where you are able to customize the information you see. For example, by using cookies as part of our internet banking, you can personalize your site. Each time you access your internet banking homepage, the browser will remember your preferences until the cookie expires. Harris also uses cookies to identify what sections of our site are visited most often so we can provide more information on the topics and subjects that our customers are interested in.
You may determine if and how a cookie will be accepted by your system by configuring your preferences or options in your browser. However, since some of our applications use cookies to manage your session, disabling a cookie may cause some banking functions to not work properly.
