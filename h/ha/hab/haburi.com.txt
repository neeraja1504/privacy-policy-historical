IV. Cookies and pixel tags
1. What are cookies and pixel tags?
We use cookies on our website. These are small files which are automatically created by your browser and which are stored on your device (laptop, tablet, smartphone or the like) when you visit our website. Cookies do not damage your computer and do not contain viruses, Trojans or any other malware.
Information is stored in the cookie relating to the specific device used. This does not mean, though, that we can immediately establish your identity.
We use pixel tags (also called tracking pixels) in our online offering. Pixels are small graphics which are integrated using the HTML code of our webpage. The pixel tag does not store or change any information on your device, pixels also do not damage your device and do not contain viruses, Trojans or any other malware.
Pixels can send personal data such as your IP address, the referrer URL of the website visited, the time the pixel was viewed, the browser used and previously placed cookie information to a web server. As a result reach measurements and other statistical analyses which serve to optimise our offering can also be conducted.
The use of cookies makes it easier for you to use our website. We use for example so-called session cookies in order to recognise that you have already visited individual pages of our website, to recognise that you have already logged into your user account or to display the shopping basket. These are deleted automatically after you leave our site.
We also use temporary, so-called comfort cookies to optimise the user-friendliness of the website, which are stored on your device for a specific period of time. If you visit our website again in order to use our services, it automatically identifies that you have already visited us and what entries and settings you have made so that you do not have to input these again. These are usually deleted after a maximum of 30 days. Only those comfort cookies with language settings store these for 365 days.
We also use cookies and pixel tags in third-party tools in order to statistically record the use of our website and to analyse the use of our website for the purpose of optimising our offering for you (see under V). These analysis, tracking and targeting cookies allow us to automatically recognise that you have already visited us when you visit our website again. These cookies are deleted automatically after a defined period of time.
2. On which legal basis is the processing with the use of cookies and pixel tags based?
The data processed with the use of cookies and pixel tags is necessary for the aforementioned purposes to protect our legitimate interests in the analysis, optimisation and efficient operation of our website as well as the legitimate interests of third parties pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 Clause 1 Letter f GDPR.
3. What opt-out do you have?
Most browsers accept cookies and pixels automatically. However, you can configure your browser so that no cookies are stored on your computer or a notice always appears before a new cookie is created.
The complete deactivation of cookies may result, though, in you not being able to use all of the functions of our website. Instructions on how to turn off cookies in your browser can be found in the Help function of your browser or under the following links:

If you would like to opt-out of the deployment of the tool with effect for the future, you can also refuse the placement of the cookie required to do this through the setting in your browser which deactivates the automatic placement of cookies generally.

This enables us to show certain groups of pseudonymised visitors to our website, who also use Facebook, advertising on Facebook that is tailored individually to them and their interests.
A Facebook Custom Audience pixel tag is integrated into our website. This is a Java script code through which non-personal data about the use of the website is stored. This includes your IP address, the browser used and the access and target page. This information is transferred to Facebook servers in the US. Facebook is subject to the EU-US Privacy Shield, so that an appropriate level of data protection is guaranteed.

time of the server request,
is sent to a Google server in the USA, where it is stored. Google complies with the data protection regulations of the US Privacy Shield and is registered with the US Privacy Shield programme of the US Department of Commerce.
We have also concluded a contract data processing agreement for the use of Google Analytics. With this agreement Google assures that it processes the data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and protects the rights of the data subject.
The information is used to analyse the use of the website, to compile reports on the website activities and to perform other services related to the use of the website and the internet for market research purposes and to ensure that these websites are tailored to the needs of users.
This information is also forwarded to third parties insofar as this is allowed by law or if third parties process this data on behalf of Google. Under no circumstances will your IP address be linked to other Google data. The IP addresses are anonymised, as a result they cannot be assigned to users (IP masking).
As an alternative to the browser add-on, in particular with browsers on mobile devices, you can also prevent the collection of data by Google Analytics by clicking on this link. An opt-out cookie will be placed which will prevent your data from being collected when you visit this website in future.

These cookies expire after 180 days. If the user visits certain pages of the website of the AdWords customer and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the customer can tell that the user has clicked on the advertisement and been redirected to this page.
The information produced by the cookie on your use of this website is sent to a Google server in the USA, where it is stored. Google complies with the data protection regulations of the US Privacy Shield and is registered with the US Privacy Shield programme of the US Department of Commerce. We have also concluded a contract data processing agreement for the use of Google AdWords. With this agreement Google assures that it processes the data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and protects the rights of the data subject.

The information obtained with the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for Conversion Tracking. We learn the total number of users who have clicked on their advertisement and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not obtain any information with which users can be personally identified.
If you do not want to participate in the tracking process, you can also refuse to accept the placement of a cookie required for this purpose, for example by a browser setting which generally deactivates the automatic placement of cookies.
