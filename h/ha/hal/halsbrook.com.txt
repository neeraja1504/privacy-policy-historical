Our Policy:
Welcome to the web site (the “Site”) of Halsbrook, Inc. (“Halsbrook”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). This Site is operated by Halsbrook and has been created to provide information about our company and to provide quality fashion retail products and services (the “Halsbrook Services”) to our Site visitors (“you”, “your”). This Privacy Policy sets forth Halsbrook’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected from Site visitors.

This Personal Data and other data connected to your name may include, without limitation, your full name, your date of birth, your mailing and other contact information, your clothing sizes and preferences and details of transactions you carry out through the Site. Wherever Halsbrook collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.
By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to this Site, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Halsbrook and the authorized third parties referred to herein.

Non-Identifiable Data: When you interact with Halsbrook through the Site, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Halsbrook may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Halsbrook affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.
In operating this Site, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features.
In addition, this Site may enable the use of the Adobe Flash Player. Adobe’s Flash Player is used by the vast majority of websites that offer video and other interactive content. By default, your use of the Adobe Flash Player generates “flash cookies” (also known as “persistent identification elements” or “local shared objects”). The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use flash cookies to remember user settings, preferences and usage similar to the browser cookies referenced above. You can disable, delete and control the degree to which you accept flash cookies by accessing your Adobe Flash Player management tools directly through the settings manager for Adobe Flash, located  here. If you do not allow flash cookies to take any disc space on your computer, you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain features on this Site. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies, flash cookies, and similar files by Company only and does not cover the use of cookies, flash cookies, and similar files by any third-party advertisers or websites linked to this Site.

When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.

You may also be able to modify your privacy settings with these Social Media Services to, for example, control what information the Social Media Services disclose to other entities, including Halsbrook. When you use Social Media Services in conjunction with the Site, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Site to access that Social Media Service, however you will provide your login information, like your password, directly to such Social Media Service (and not to Halsbrook). As part of such integration, the Social Media Service will provide Halsbrook with access to certain information that you have provided to such Social Media Service, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and, if and to the extent applicable, the policies of such Social Media Services. However, please remember that the manner in which Social Media Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of the applicable Social Media Services provider, and, as a result, Halsbrook shall not have any liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of Social Media Services that may be enabled within and/or otherwise accessible through the Site.
