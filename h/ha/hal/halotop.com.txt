PRIVACY POLICY
Eden Creamery LLC, d/b/a Halo Top Creamery, its direct and indirect subsidiaries, parents and affiliates (collectively, “ Halo Top ”, “ us ” or “ we ”) are concerned about online privacy issues and want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose any personal information that individually identifies you (e.g. your name, address, phone number, e-mail address). As used in this privacy policy (the “ Privacy Policy ”), personal information means any information about an identifiable individual. This Privacy Policy explains our online information practices and the choices you, as a visitor to any web page, web site application or platform offered through any social media website operated or provided by Halo Top related to its United States operations (collectively, “ Halo Top Websites ” and each is a “ Halo Top Website ”) can make about the collection and use of your personal information. We will only collect, use and disclose your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
We may collect personal information from you when you voluntarily provide it to us through a number of features available on or through a Halo Top Website. For example, we may ask you to provide personal information if you:
ask to receive online information from us, such as e-mail newsletters or e-mail updates;
participate in a review, survey, a consumer research panel, or similar type of activity; and/or
otherwise participate in features of a Halo Top Website that ask for personal information.
In addition, if you otherwise request any information, service or other offering from us, you may be required to provide your contact or other information in order for us to process your request.
Your participation in any of these activities is voluntary and we will only use the personal information that you provide for the purposes for which it was collected. For example, we may use the personal information you provide to: respond to your questions or comments; fulfill your requests; provide service(s) and/or products to you; identify your needs and/or preferences; administer and manage our business operations; or otherwise provide or improve our products and/or services.
You will always have the opportunity to “unsubscribe” from receiving e-mail or other communications at any time.
If you contact one of our consumer service representatives through a Halo Top Website, we may ask you for personal information such as your name, address, phone number, or e-mail address so that we can respond to your questions or comments.

PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.
