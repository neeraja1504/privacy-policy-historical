At halloweenadventure.com we are committed to protecting your privacy online. Below is a brief overview of the highlights of our Privacy & Security Policy. This will give you a summary of how information is collected from you and how it is used.
Your Personal and Payment Information is Safe
Whenever you provide any personal or payment information (e.g., when making a purchase), we use SSL technology to make sure that it is "encrypted" (all scrambled up) so that no one else can read it while it is being transmitted over the Internet, and all information is safely stored behind our firewall.
Information Collected
When you shop on our site, we collect personal information from you such as your name, e-mail address, billing address, shipping address, telephone number and product selections so that you can order products from us. All Credit Card information is stored in our database in an encrypted format, behind a secured, hacker-proof firewall. For your security, the complete credit card number will never be made available to view. Encrypted Credit Card information is stored for the sole purpose of expediting the checkout process for future purchases. We may also collect IP address, domain types (e.g. .com or .org, etc.), your browser type, the country, state and the pages of our site and the length of time of your visit during your visit.
How Information is Used
We do not sell or rent your personal information to others. We use customer information we collect only for the purposes of filling orders, contacting purchasers to inform them of their order status, sending promotional information, enhancing the operation of our site, statistical purposes and to administer our systems.
