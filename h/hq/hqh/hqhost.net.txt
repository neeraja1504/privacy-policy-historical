Hosting Medical Sites
For those wishing to host online pharmacies or pharmacy affiliate sites, we offer the list of legislative documents that HQHOst.net Acceptable Use Policy is based on:
Controlled Substances bsgances Act by the Congress of USA
Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act by the Congress of USA
These acts define such notions as "online pharmacy", "controlled substances", and "valid prescription".
"Online pharmacy" means a person, entity, or Internet site, whether in the United States or abroad, that knowingly or intentionally delivers, distributes, or dispenses, or offers or attempts to deliver, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance by means of the Internet.
"Controlled substance" means a drug or other substance, or immediate precursor,included in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V of part B of this subchapter. The term does not include distilled spirits, wine, malt beverages, or tobacco, as those terms are defined or used in subtitle E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. For more details see.
"Valid prescription" means a prescription that is issued for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of professional practice by a practitioner who has conducted at least 1 in-person medical evaluation of the patient or a covering practitioner. More about it here.
According to the new legislation you can deliver or distribute the controlled substances only if a client gets valid prescription and an online pharmacy site displays on its homepage in a clear manner:
- The name and address of the pharmacy as it appears on the pharmacy's Drug Enforcement Administration certificate of registration;
- The pharmacy's telephone number and email address;
- The name, professional degree, and States of licensure of the pharmacist-in-charge, and a telephone number at which the pharmacist-in-charge can be contacted;
- A list of the States in which the pharmacy is licensed to dispense controlled substances;
- A certification that the pharmacy is registered under this part to deliver, distribute, or dispense by means of the Internet controlled substances;
- The name, address, telephone number, professional degree, and States of licensure of any practitioner who has a contractual relationship to provide medical evaluations or issue prescriptions for controlled substances;
- The following statement, unless revised by the Attorney General by regulation: `This online pharmacy will only dispense a controlled substance to a person who has a valid prescription issued for a legitimate medical purpose based upon a medical relationship with a prescribing practitioner. This includes at least one prior in-person medical evaluation or medical evaluation via telemedicine in accordance with applicable requirements of section 309 of the Controlled Substances Act;
The Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act also states offences involving spreading or distributing any of the controlled substances without having all the proper licensing. The felony implies a sentence to a term of imprisonment from 10 to 20 (in case if using controlled substance caused death or serious bodily injury) years. See Sec.311 at for more details.
Besides the above mentioned system of licensing there's also a network of professional associations that can help you to obtain the accreditation in the pharmaceutical industry. We can also recommend you to visit National Association of Boards of Pharmacy site http://www.nabp.net/ where you can apply for VIPPS (Verified Internet Pharmacy Practices Sites) licensing. VIPPS pharmacy sites are identified by the VIPPS hyperlink seal displayed on their Web site. By clicking on the seal, a visitor is linked to the NABP VIPPS site where verified information about the pharmacy is maintained by NABP.
Please note that the requirements mentioned above concern only distributing or attempting to distribute controlled substances and NOT the so-called .life style drugs. such as Viagra, weight control medications and tranquillizers, as the majority of .life style drugs. are not controlled substances. An online pharmacy selling Viagra, weight control medications and tranquilizers, should have the address on the homepage.
We hope that this information was useful for you and will help you to establish a long-running business!

Accordingly, we may require clients to provide additional forms of identity should they wish to obtain information about their account details. We may also use the information our clients provide to email monthly invoices, system updates and notification mailings to the primary contact e-mail on file, or to contact them about other products or services that we think may be of their interest.
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our website and servers, track access, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. However, it is possible that personal information about a customer may be included in the log files due to the normal functions of IP addresses and Web browsing.
