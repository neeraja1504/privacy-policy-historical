2. Information we collect
A. Information we collect about you
When you register on our website or place an order, we collect your name and email address. This allows us to process your registration, fulfil your order and send you important service messages. When you first register or create a family tree, we ask for your date of birth. Providing this information is optional. Knowing your date of birth allows Findmypast to see how people of different ages use our site and we can give you more relevant content.
Sometimes, we may ask you to provide other contact details, such as phone number or address, to carry out our surveys. You will always be given the option to withhold these contact details at the time you complete the survey.
We do collect some information from cookies, pixels and similar software which allows us to understand how you arrive on our websites, how you use and navigate around them, and how you interact with our email. This information is used to improve our services and communication. We obtain information about your location to give us insight on usage across different geographic areas.
We obtain some information from Google Analytics and Facebook. The Facebook information we obtain is limited to your email address and only that which you have previously agreed with Facebook that they can share.
We do collect the mobile device identifier (device ID) provided by your mobile device operating system from users of the Findmypast App. The device ID allows us to link your device to your account as well as to send you push notifications if you choose to have notifications from the Findmypast App.

B. Information you provide to us
If you create a family tree or create content on our website, we also collect that information, which may include personal information about you and other people (for example, names and birthdays of people in your family). You should ensure, if you provide personal information about people in your family who are living and not deceased, that you have the consent from the relevant individual to include that personal information on the website.
We do not collect sensitive personal information (also known as ‘special categories of data’) about you except when you specifically knowingly provide it and have consented to this. Examples are adding your religious belief to a family tree. More details about the privacy of the family tree are available below.
3. How we use the information
A. We will use your personal information for a number of purposes including:
To manage our website (including your account);
To provide you with a free trial (if requested);
To process orders and provide our services, goods or online content, to provide you with information about them and to deal with your requests and queries;
For administration purposes. This means we may contact you regarding goods or services ordered or online content you have signed up for, to let you know that a service or online site has been suspended for maintenance, if your subscription is about to expire to ask if you wish to renew it, or if an online account has become dormant to ask if you wish to retain the account before we close it;
To provide advanced website features to you and others;
(For IP addresses and device identifiers) to identify the location of users, to establish the number of visits from different countries, to limit/cap adverts of a certain type, and to personalise content and emails;
To undertake analysis and research to improve our services and goods offered;
To improve your search results;
To tailor a certain amount of advertising to individual users based on viewing and/or purchase habits. This is a common practice known as online behavioural advertising;
To show you relevant advertising on third party sites (e.g. Facebook, Google, and Twitter). Some third party sites allow you to request not to see messages from specific advertisers;
To conduct surveys with you (where you have consented to us contacting you for such purpose);
To provide personalised communications (more details below);
To offer users a more relevant, tailored service, based on our analysis of personal information you provide and your activity on our (and other) services; and
To undertake marketing and strategic development activities, where we will only use and disclose information in aggregate (so no individuals are identified).
B. Communications
i. Service messages
We send service emails to you to administer the service. Service emails include registration and payment confirmations and emails that provide useful information about how to use a service or feature when you sign up or start using it. We will also send you a service email if we make a fundamental change to the website, or to our terms & conditions that we think we need to make you aware of, or to let you know important information about your account.
ii. Marketing messages
We use your email address to update you on new products, services and subscription offers. We will only contact you with your consent. You are entitled to withhold this consent and refrain from receiving such communications by selecting the appropriate option on the web form that collects your details. You can also update these options at any time by logging into your account and adjusting your preferences, by contacting us by email at support@findmypast.com, by calling +44 (0)20 3326 6300 [UK, IE, AU] / +1 (855) 246-8234 [US] or by post to Findmypast, 6 Chapel Place, Rivington Street, London EC2A 3DQ. We will always provide you with a way of opting out of receiving future marketing messages from us each time we send them to you.
iii. Tree hints and related records
Tree hints and record matching are part of the Findmypast service. As you build your family tree we will send you family tree hints and missions by email using the information you have provided and matching that against the records we hold in our historical records. We will also notify you of records related to the records you have recently viewed. You can use these valuable hints and records to add more information to your family tree. This is part of the Findmypast service, but it you wish to stop the hint emails you can change your preferences through the Communication Preferences centre available within your account.
4. What if I don’t provide some or all of the information requested?
The impact of this will depend on what information you withhold, but the main impacts may be:
We will not be able to process or fully process your order;
We will not be able to contact you to let you know of problems regarding your order or the goods/services provided;
We will not be able to respond fully to requests and queries you may have;
We cannot personalise the service you receive. So, if you are online you will have to search more for the content type you normally view or for similar/related products; and/or
We won’t be able to limit online adverts to products or services you have shown interest in and so you may receive adverts that are not related to your interests.
5. What grounds (legal basis) are we processing the data under?
There are a number of grounds under which we process your personal information. These are:
Contractual – we need the information to perform the contract for goods or services you have requested/ordered including payment, delivery etc;
Legal – should we be legally required to contact you concerning a purchase or service;
Legitimate interest – this means the processing is in Findmypast’s interest. It allows us to manage the customer relationship effectively and efficiently and improve the goods and/or services we provide by better understanding how our online provisions are used and which goods are popular with which groups of individuals; and/or
Consent – where you have given us consent to market to you.
6. Family Tree
Building your family tree is an immensely valuable activity while you are exploring your family history. Trees allow you to store all your family history in one central area. You can attach historic records that you find on our site to your trees. At Findmypast, we are continuously improving our family trees and finding new ways for you to get the most out of your Findmypast experience. Recently, we have introduced tree-to-tree hinting (“Tree 2 Tree Hinting”).
A. Privacy. One of the most valuable resources for a community of users researching and building their family trees is access to the historical research of others. Many people, often unknown to each other, share common ancestors within a few generations, and those people know different parts of the family tree. By joining forces and connecting this knowledge, we can all discover new parts of our family history – parts we never had access to before.
Sharing information about deceased ancestors is vital for Tree 2 Tree Hinting. When you create your family tree or upload a GEDCOM (a file format used for exchanging genealogical data), the privacy settings are set to share deceased ancestors by default. the privacy settings are set to share details of your deceased ancestors by default. This means that information on your deceased ancestors may be offered to other members as a hint if their tree appears to share common ancestors with your tree.
We provide you with privacy controls to manage your family tree and control who can see the information in it within the Tree Settings page. You should familiarise yourself with how these controls work as you are responsible for using them.
i. When participating in Tree 2 Tree Hinting and ‘Sharing Deceased Ancestors’ is switched on
All personal information about living people remains private to you.
Information on your deceased ancestors may be offered to other members as explained above.
For deceased ancestors, the following information may be offered as part of a hint:
Timelines
Facts and events – together with sources and attached records
Notes
Photographs and media will not be shared. In the future, we will introduce more granular privacy controls to enable selective sharing of photographs.
If your ancestors are not marked as deceased, but were born more than 110 years ago we will assume they are deceased. Please contact support@findmypast.co.uk if this is incorrect.
_ii. When not participating in Tree 2 Tree Hinting and sharing Deceased Ancestors is switched off _
You will not benefit from the Tree 2 Tree Hinting service and the historical information contained in the trees of the Findmypast community.
Other users will not be able to receive hints relating to deceased ancestors in your tree.
B. Tree deletion. Within the View All Trees area you can find an option to Remove Tree. This option will remove your tree from your tree view. Findmypast will delete all the data related to living people. In cases where a person is not noted as deceased, we will remove all the data for those who were born less than 110 years ago. If you want your entire tree deleted from Findmypast, please contact privacy@findmypast.com. Once Tree 2 Tree Hinting is available, deleting your tree will not delete branches you have shared with other users.
C. Removal of unauthorised data. We reserve the right (at our own discretion) to remove any personal information which you have included in your family tree about people who are living if we are alerted to the fact that this personal information was used without that person’s permission. If you become aware that your personal information has been included in somebody else's tree without your permission or is being misused in any other way on the website, please send an email to our Customer Support team support@findmypast.com with details and we will investigate and, if necessary, remove this information. The information added about deceased persons is not considered personal data under this policy.
D. Sharing family tree data with FamilySearch.
Findmypast no longer shares family tree d with our partner FamilySearch. If you created a family tree between 1 November 2018 and 31 March 2019 (when we were testing a new community shared tree product) and you gave your consent, we shared your personal information with FamilySearch in order to provide you with the community shared tree service. The following items would have been shared with FamilySearch:
Name
Birthdate
Gender
IP Address
Contributions to the community shared tree
FamilySearch is a data controller with a separate privacy policy. This policy was made available to all users who consented to share their data with FamilySearch and is available here. If you have any questions or concerns about your personal information please contact privacy@findmypast.co.uk.
7. Historic records and record matching
A. Historic Records
Findmypast works with a number of trust third parties to bring you millions of historical records to assist you with your family history research. A full list of our partners is available on the Our Partners page on our website. Historic records on the site are reproduced under a third party agreement with licensors or we reproduce records that are within the public domain. We will continue to host these records as long as we retain an agreement with the licensor or as long as they are within the public domain.
You will find information about living individuals in some of our records. Examples of these records include civil birth and marriage indexes, electoral registers, the Companies House register, and more. The records we hold which contain the names of living people are public record and we provide the data based on our legitimate interest. In the examples, the records have been made public by the General Register Office or the Electoral Register. Records of living individuals allow users to build their family tree and research their family history from the current generation.
If you have any questions about these records, please contact our customer support at privacy@findmypast.co.uk. We will remove records of living people if it is requested by the individual named in the record. If you want to be removed from the UK Electoral Register records you will need to contact 192.com, who we use to access these records.
B. Record matching
Findmypast uses record matching technologies to suggest possible matches between historical records on Findmypast and associated partner trees on Family Historian or Roots Magic, family tree building software.
Record matching on Findmypast automatically matches historical records for your family tree. These records are pulled from our vast records database. Record matching will save you time with your research and allow you to make fascinating discoveries through historical records such as birth, marriage and death documents and census records.
When record matching is enabled within partner sites such as Family Historian, Roots Magic, or other Desktop Software partners, information from small parts of your family tree is passed between the sites without you having to do anything, to a matching service on the Findmypast website. This information includes basic information such as names, dates and places associated with individuals and their close relatives. Findmypast uses this data to find accurate matches for relevant individuals. The matching service provides partner site users with suggested matches of ancestors’ birth, marriage, and death records. We will also provide matches for census records. As a Findmypast customer, you can then add these records to your tree. The service will match against living relatives.
Please note this information is not retained by Findmypast and is deleted automatically after matches are calculated and displayed to you. Only partner site users receive Findmypast hints. Findmypast users do not receive hints about trees on the partner site.
The partner site will show matches in its search window where matches are found. To find out more about these matches, follow the links provided and review them. You will then be able to accept or reject matches. Please note that some matches can be viewed and confirmed for free, while others require a Findmypast data subscription. In order to review these matches, you will need to subscribe to Findmypast and create an account.
The information passed to Findmypast is never used for any other purpose and will never be displayed, sold, licensed or used in any manner whatsoever. If you have any question or concerns, you can email support@findmypast.co.uk or call Customer Support on +44(0)20 3326 6300 [UK, IE, AU]; +1 (855) 246-8234 [US]
