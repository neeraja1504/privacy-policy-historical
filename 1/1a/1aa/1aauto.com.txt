1A Auto, Inc.
Privacy Policy
This privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy” or “Policy”) governs the manner in which 1A Auto, Inc. (“1A Auto,” “we,” “our,” “us” and similar terms) collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users who register for and/or use this website (the “Website”). We take reasonable steps to protect user privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this Policy and with applicable U.S. state and federal laws. WE TAKE THESE PRECAUTIONS IN AN EFFORT TO PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION AGAINST SECURITY BREACHES. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT A GUARANTEE THAT SUCH INFORMATION MAY NOT BE ACCESSED, DISCLOSED, ALTERED, OR DESTROYED BY BREACH OF SUCH FIREWALLS AND SECURE SERVER SOFTWARE. BY USING THE WEBSITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO ASSUME THESE RISKS.
In this Policy, “user” or “you” means any individual using the Website. This Policy forms part of and is incorporated into our Terms of Use published at https://www.1aauto.com/customer_service/terms_of_u... (the “Terms of Use”).
BY ACCESSING OR USING THE WEBSITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR TERMS OF USE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE WEBSITE.
What Information Do We Collect?
Limited Personal Information: We may collect certain personal information about you in connection with your use of the Website, including: (a) when you register to use the Website, we may collect the personal information through our online registration form, such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, vehicle information, username, password and other information detailed therein; (b) if you pay your fees by credit card, we (or a third-party payment processor acting on our behalf) will collect the name, expiration date and credit card number for the relevant card; and (c) if you communicate with us by email but do not otherwise register to use the Website, we will collect your email address. All of this information is referred to in this Policy as “Personal Information.” If you contact 1A Auto and disclose additional personal information, we may store that information.
In order to access the online store section of the Website, rather than creating a 1A Auto account, you may register using your login credentials from your Facebook, Google or other social media account (your “Connected Account”). If you use a Connected Account, we may access and collect certain personal information (such as your name and email address) that your privacy settings on such Connected Account permit us to access.
User Data. “User Data” means all data—other than Personal Information—that users provide us regarding or related to themselves or their use of or access to the Website. As described in the Terms of Use, we store User Data and correlate User Data with third-party data in order to make the Website available.
Web Tracking Information and Cookies : We and our Contractors (as defined below) may use web tracking technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and clear GIFs in order to operate the Website efficiently and to collect data related to usage of the Website. Such collected data (“Web Tracking Information”) may include the address of other websites you have visited, the type of browser you are using, device model, device ID and other unique device identifiers, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, what pages in the Website you visit and what links you clicked on, and whether you opened email communications we send to you. We and our Contractors may also use web tracking technologies that are placed in web pages on the Website or in email communications to collect information about actions that users take when they interact with the Website or such email communications. We do not correlate Web Tracking Information to individual user Personal Information. Some Web Tracking Information may include data, such as IP address data, that is unique to you. We use this information not to identify individual users, but to analyze trends, administer the Website, track users’ movements around the Website, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole which provides us with the ability to determine aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns.
A cookie is a small text file or record that is stored on a user’s computer when you visit our Website, which collects information about your activities on the Website. The cookies transmit this information back to the computers at 1A Auto or our third-party distributors of banners and newsletters; these computers are, generally speaking, the only computers which are authorized to read such information. The information captured makes it possible for us to: (i) speed navigation, and provide you with custom tailored content; (ii) remember information you give to us, so you don’t have to reenter it each time you visit the Website; (iii) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; and (iv) monitor total number of visitors, pages viewed, and the total number of banners served. You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or you can turn off cookie placement. Also, by not using cookies, your overall internet browsing experience will be affected.
