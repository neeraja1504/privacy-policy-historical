How do I know my order information is secure?
Providing a safe and secure environment for your order information is our top priority. THE15DOLLARSTORE.COM protects the security of your online transaction by taking advantage of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. When you order, your credit card information is secure. THE15DOLLARSTORE.COM uses digital certificates provided by Equifax which are required for SSL, the industry standard for encryption.

To check the security of your connection when checking out, look at the lower right-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http to "https."
To further protect your security, we suggest you close your browser window after you have finished your visit, especially if you are using a computer shared by others.
