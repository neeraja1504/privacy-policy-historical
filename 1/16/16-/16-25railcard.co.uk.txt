We will treat your data in an appropriate and lawful manner, in accordance with data protection laws.

We will not share your details with any other third parties unless you provide us with your consent. If you consent to marketing, you can find out more about the communications you’ll receive in our Marketing & Contact Policy.
If you enter one of our prize draws for market research or competitions, your entry will be held by our suppliers (Survey Monkey for research and Quiet Storm for competitions). Winners of competitions will be notified using the contact details provided in their entry. Where a prize is being offered by one of our partners, your contact details may be provided to them in order for them to fulfil the prize.
Keeping your data safe
We protect your privacy by ensuring we have the appropriate security measures in place. We ensure that our suppliers process your data in an appropriate, lawful and safe manner, and within the EU only.
If you participate in a survey with us your data will be held with our supplier (Survey Monkey) in the United States under an EU approved data protection framework. It will be anonymised for reporting purposes and then deleted after 30 days.
What we do with your data
We use your data to provide you with the Railcard, and:
To provide you with customer support services, for example if you lose your Railcard
To send you information about any changes to your Railcard’s terms and conditions
To alert you to any changes to this privacy policy
To remind you when your Railcard is due to expire.
We do some analysis on our customer data for sales analysis and marketing research.
We do not use your data for automated decision making. However we do demographic, geographic and attitude analysis to understand who our customers are in groups rather than as individuals.
If you enter one of our prize draws for market research or competitions, the data we collect will be kept securely whilst the survey and/or competition is live.

Personal details will only be used for the purpose of the prize draw and will be deleted once the winner has been confirmed.

We keep your data while your Railcard is valid, and for two years thereafter to enable you to renew easily within that period. During this time you may receive other communications from us if you have consented.
If you have started but not completed a Railcard application, the data you have entered will be held for 30 days to allow you to return to complete your application.  After that time it will be deleted.
If you participate in a prize draw for market research or competitions, your entry will be held for 30 days and then deleted.
