Pop Goes America:
Security
Credit Card sensitive information will not be stored in our transaction database. We will not hold nor store credit card numbers online. Pop Goes America feels there is no need to keep this information online after the transaction is approved and processed.
Secure Socket Layer (SSL):
SSL, which stands for Secure Socket Layer, is an industry-standard process of passing sensitive information between computers. SSL is often used to securely transfer credit card numbers and other sensitive information across the Internet. SSL binds a person's or a computer's identity to a pair of electronic keys. These keys can be used to encrypt and digitally "sign" information to prove its authenticity. SSL and Digital IDs together provide a complete security solution, assuring the identity of all parties involved in an online transaction.
Pop Goes America uses SSL. This can be verified if you are using current Netscape or Internet Explorer browsers. By looking at your browser window, if you see a lock thats highlighted in yellow, then SSL is currently active. Your order and sensitive information can then be sent securely.
