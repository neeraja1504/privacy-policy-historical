Occasionally, we email our customers to let them know about new products, services, offers, promotions, and anything else we think might be of interest (unless you don’t want us to, in which case just let us know and we won’t). We keep all the email we receive and send so that we can find all the information we need about particular order histories. We send email to customers only if it concerns a specific order or question, or if the customer has opted to receive promotional emails.

We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.
Wherever you submit sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page. We don't store any sensitive information.
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
