General
12Frenz collects personal information when you register with 12Frenz, when you use 12Frenz products or services, when you visit 12Frenz pages or the pages of certain 12Frenz partners, and when you enter promotions. 12Frenz may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.
When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, post code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. When you register with 12Frenz and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.
12Frenz collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners.
12Frenz automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser and/or hand phone, including your IP address, 12Frenz cookie information, phone number and the page you request.
12Frenz uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.
Children
When a child under age 13 attempts to register with 12Frenz, we ask the child to have a parent or guardian create a 12Frenz Family Account to obtain parental permission.
12Frenz does not contact children under age 13 about special offers or for marketing purposes without a parent's permission.
12Frenz does not ask a child under age 13 for more personal information, as a condition of participation, than is reasonably necessary to participate in a given activity or promotion.

Information Sharing and Disclosure
12Frenz does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with 12Frenz under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help 12Frenz communicate with you about offers from 12Frenz and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
We have a parent's permission to share the information if the user is a child under age 13. Parents have the option of allowing 12Frenz to collect and use their child's information without consenting to 12Frenz sharing of this information with people and companies who may use this information for their own purposes.
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of 12Frenz's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
We transfer information about you if 12Frenz is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, 12Frenz will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
12Frenz displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.
12Frenz does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
12Frenz advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stopk brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies).
12Frenz works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business. For more information regarding providers of products or services that you've requested please read our detailed reference links.
