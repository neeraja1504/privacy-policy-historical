We use information received from our cookies for marketing purposes and to improve our on-line offering of services and products. We may also do so to evaluate our site's technical capacity and to review the navigational structure of our site, e.g., to revise or restructure our web site for easier and more intuitive movement throughout.
Currently, the information we collect with cookies is only reviewed in an aggregated form, which is not personally identifiable. In the future, however, we may correlate the information received from cookies with personally identifiable information, to identify specific users and track their web site usage. This personally identifiable information will be limited to contact information, such as the user's name, address, phone number, fax number, and e-mail address. Our use of this combined information will continue to be solely for the purposes stated above with respect to information collected through cookies.
Whether or not the information received from cookies is correlated to any specific user, we do not disclose, sell, rent or share any information derived from cookies with any third parties.
