What cookies are and how they are used;
How your information is used;
Who is collecting your information;
With whom your information may be shared;

What personally identifiable information does 123India.com collect from me?
123India.com collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of web sites.
Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, 123India.com asks for your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry and personal interests. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to 123India.com - you are given a 123India.com ID and are able to take full advantage of 123India.com's many offerings.
In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by 123India.com and/or our many partners; when you submit a listing for a web site; and when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. If you contact 123India.com we may keep a record of that correspondence. 123India.com also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Wherever 123India.com collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.
What are cookies and how does 123India.com use them?
As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, 123India.com uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sites on 123India.com where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies. (See "What are my choices regarding collection, use and distribution of my information?" for more information on cookies.) Generally, we use cookies to:
1. Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "Sign In" and is modified when you "Sign Out" of our services. 123India.com also uses cookies to store your zip code for other services, such as Yellow Pages.
2. Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing 123India.com is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior.
3. Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes and contests. When a 123India.com-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie indicates the player's progress through the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings.
4. Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of 123India.com's network of web sites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on 123India.com a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites.

This includes personalization services, interactive communications, and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about you, 123India.com is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you.
