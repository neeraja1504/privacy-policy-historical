Privacy
Privacy Policy
Introduction
The Privacy Policy below will govern your 1iota membership and any information you provide on this site. In order to become a member of 1iota we must ask you to provide us with information about yourself. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect and how we use that information. 1iota takes the privacy of your personal information very seriously and will use your information only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Changes of Policy
This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to 1iota or as we incorporate new suggestions from our members. If we are going to use or disclose your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time we collected the information, you will be notified by email or by means of a notice on our homepage. 1iota may make improvements and/or changes in our services or products described in the site, including the terms and conditions of your use of this site, without liability. 1iota reserves the right to change these conditions at anytime.
Required Information
When you register for an account with our site you will be asked for your contact information such as first and last name, gender, birthday, city, state and zip code. In order to become a basic member of 1iota, you must provide this information to us. A user can access their submitted information and make changes at anytime on the “my basic account info” section of the site. A user’s last name cannot be altered on the site due to members’ attempts to transfer e-tickets as our e-tickets are non-transferable. To alter your last name, please send an email to support@1iota.com. A user can also cancel their membership at any time by visiting the “resign your account” section of the site.
Termination of your membership does not affect the lawfulness of processing or using any information that you provided to us based on consent before termination.   Your termination of your membership with 1iota.com is also a withdrawal of consent for processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.  If you are a European resident please note that your information will be transferred outside Europe. If necessary, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
You have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.
Optional Information
Our site offers members the ability to set up an optional casting profile, under the “my casting info” section of the site. Information included in this profile pertains to members " personal attributes, interests, and preferences, such as, ethnicity, hair color, eye color, height, weight and special skills. Our site also offers members the ability to submit and store photos of themselves, under the “my photo” section of the site. Our site offers members the ability to receive wireless updates by entering your wireless number on the “my wireless alerts section” of the site and checking the “please send 1iota updates and information box.”  A member can opt-out of this feature at any time by unchecking the same box. Our site offers members the ability to receive emails from the site regarding upcoming events and event updates. A member can opt-out of receiving emails by clicking the “please send me 1iota event updates and info” on the “my email preferences” section of the site. If you choose to use our referral service to email a friend about an upcoming event, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. 1iota does not store this information.
Customer Feedback
We encourage you to share your comments and questions with us. We promise to read all the mail that is sent to us, but we may not be able to respond to it all. We will retain such information in the records of your membership. We retain these records in order to measure and improve our customer service. We may, over time, delete these records if permitted by law.
Use and Disclosure
We use the information we collect about you in order to (1) provide membership services, (2) determine your eligibility to be selected for special events, shows and targeted marketing opportunities, and (3) to operate our site efficiently and continue to improve our membership relations and services.
Disclosure to Third Parties
1iota will not share any of your personally identifiable information with third parties except in the limited circumstances described below.
If selected for a show, 1iota will be authorized to use the information provided, to grant you access to the event and take the proper security precautions required by event staff or security (such as background checks). Background checks will only be done when attending a national security event, which will be specified in the event description. A background check will take place upon registering for that event by the respected government agency.
We use contact information to send the user information needed to maintain their account, to contact them when necessary, and to notify them of news about our company. We also use customer contact information to send the user promotional material from some of our partners.
We may provide the information you provide to us to the organizers of the events that you want to attend or that you actually attend or their affiliates, representatives or designees, and they may use such information consistent with their own privacy policies which could be more permissive than the terms set forth in the 1iota Privacy Policy.
We share aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. We may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors. However, these statistics will not include personal identifying information.
Account information may be released when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with applicable law; (2) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements; or (3) protect the rights, property or safety of our members and/or any third parties.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future 1iota could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by 1iota, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended as described above in the "Changes of Policy" section.
