We also may use location data, IP address or device identification number, and other information from and about devices, browsers, operating systems, manners of connecting to the internet, internet service providers or wireless carriers, or other information related to use of the Services or the Sites in de-personalized form to improve our Services or Sites and occasionally for other internal purposes.
How we disclose your information, including personal information
We do not rent, sell, or share the information that you upload to our Services or the Sites with non- affiliated third-parties, except that information may be disclosed under the following circumstances:
When we have your permission including when you choose to share information on any public portions of the Sites such as our online forums.
We may provide the personal information you provided to third party service providers that provide us with services, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those services. For example, we may transfer your credit/debit card or payment account information to third party service providers who will securely process your payments. We do not maintain any of your credit/debit card or payment account information.
These companies may use your personal information to help us provide the Services you requested and/or to communicate with you. While we may seek to require third party service providers to follow appropriate privacy practices and will not authorize them to use your information except for the express purpose for which it is provided, we do not bear any responsibility for any actions, practices or policies of third parties, except as required under the Privacy Shield Frameworks or other law.
We may share, transfer or disclose some or all of your information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction or other proceeding involving the sale, transfer, divestiture or assignment of all or a portion of our business or assets to a different entity.
We may disclose personal information to comply with laws or in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose personal information in response to a law enforcement agency’s request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, verify, prevent, enforce compliance with, or take action regarding: illegal or suspected illegal activities; suspected fraud; situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person; protection of the rights and property of 1010data, our Sites and Services, and our agents, customers, or others; or violations or suspected violations of our agreements and policies or as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements.
Finally, we may also share aggregated, anonymized or statistical information about you, including demographics data, with others for a variety of purposes, including for their own uses (e.g., for improving their products and services in connection with our Services or for other purposes that do include identification of individuals).
How we secure and store your information
We have put in place reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, and organizational procedures to help safeguard information collected or received through our Services and Sites and to protect your information from unauthorized or unlawful use, as well as the accidental loss, destruction or damage while under our control.
We are a global company with affiliates, varied business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross borders. Information collected by our Services and Sites, may be stored on your computers, on your mobile devices, or on servers controlled by us, and this information may be transferred to, accessed from, or stored and processed in, the United States or other countries which may not have data privacy laws that provide protections equivalent to those provided in your home country. However, we will protect all personal information we obtain in accordance with this policy and take reasonable steps to ensure that it is treated lawfully. We will only retain personal information for as long as needed to fulfil legitimate business purposes, including the purposes outlined in this policy, or for a period of time specifically required or allowed by applicable regulations or laws. Note that upon termination of your Services account(s), we will maintain the information uploaded to the Services for six (6) months, to enable a prompt and efficient re-engagement of your account, should you decide to do so.
While we take reasonable steps described above to secure your information, because no data transmission is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic security is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that you send to us or the security of our servers, networks or databases, and by using our Services and/or Sites you agree to assume all risk in connection with your personal information and the information you upload thereto. We are not responsible for any loss of such information. To help protect your personal information and the information you upload to the Services, please use a strong password, do not use the same passwords to access your Services accounts that you use with other accounts or services, and protect your user names and passwords to help prevent others from accessing your accounts and services.
In the unlikely event that we believe the security of your information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you. If notification is appropriate, we may notify you by e-mail, push notification, or otherwise.
Choices about receiving marketing messages
We give you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your personal information collected through our Services and/or Sites. When you register or respond to one of our communications or offers, we may ask you to make choices about receiving further marketing communications from us. In addition, should you wish to stop receiving marketing communications directly from us, you will be able to unsubscribe or opt-out, or you can contact us as described at the end of this policy and we will make the changes for you. Please remember to include your full name and email address in order that we may make the changes that you request. To opt out of communications provided by third parties, you may need to opt out or change your privacy settings with the third party. For example, if you no longer wish to receive marketing communications from us through your social media account, you can modify your privacy settings for your social media account to change or limit the information shared.
Cookies and “do not track”
“Cookies” are pieces of information that an online service transfers to your hard drive to store and sometimes track information about your device. “First Party Cookies” are cookies that we set to collect information through the Sites or within the Services for our use. “Third Party Cookies” are cookies that are set by third parties to collect information through the Sites on our behalf; such third parties may collect information for their own purposes too. We do not necessarily control or influence the specific types of information that third parties may collect through the Sites.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that. You are not obliged to accept cookies and you can adjust your browser’s setting to prevent it from accepting cookies on your device – go to www.allaboutcookies.org for instructions on how to disable cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of our Services or Sites if you do so.
First Party Cookies
We may collect information about your device using first party cookies, including, where available, your IP address, operating system and browser type for system administration.
The Services and the Sites may also use first party cookies, for example, to:
Gather customer journey information to fulfil your requests;
Provide privacy protection when you visit the Services and Sites;
Store details of your marketing preferences to improve and enhance your use of our Services and Sites;
Evaluate our advertising and promotional effectiveness;
Detect if a service has already been offered to you so that we don’t ask you again.
Third Party Cookies
Ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors, traffic measurement services, and other third parties may set cookies through the Platform and Sites and access your device if you choose to have cookies enabled in your browser or they may otherwise have access to information about your device that does not directly identify you. These third party cookies are set to, among other things, help deliver advertisements that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third party cookies and web beacons are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. If you do not want the services that third party cookies provide, you may be able to opt-out by visiting youronlinechoices.eu, aboutads.info, and/or networkadvertising.org.
Do Not Track
As discussed above, you may opt out of third party cookies at any time. However, we do not currently support any browser based Do Not Track (DNT) settings or participate in any DNT frameworks, and we do not assign any meaning to any potential DNT track signals you may send or alter any of our data collection or use practices in response to such signals.
Other websites
This policy applies only to our Services and Sites. There may be links on our Sites to third party websites over which we have no control and when you click on advertisements or links you will leave our Sites and go to another website and thereafter it is that third party’s website whose privacy policy will apply. A third party’s privacy practices may differ from ours.
We accept no responsibility or liability for any third-party practices on third party websites and advise you to carefully read third party privacy statements prior to the use of any third party website.
California privacy rights
California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt- out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place. To make such a request, please contact us as described and the end of this policy.
Access to and accuracy of personal information
If you have any questions or concerns regarding our collection, use or disclosure of your personal information or if you wish to access, correct, or delete the personal information held by us, you should contact us in writing using the information provided below. As may be provided under applicable law, we will provide you with copies of your personal information; we will require a nominal administration charge of US$10 for all individuals located outside the European Economic Area. We are also obliged to request that you provide us with identification so that we can be certain that you are entitled to receive the requested data.
