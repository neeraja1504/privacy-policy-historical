Information 1HappyBirthday gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because 1HappyBirthday derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising.
1HappyBirthday gathers User Information by The Following Processes:
We offer the following services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:
Song download or registration
We offer songs to users. 1HappyBirthday gathers the email addresses and contact information of users who voluntarily subscribe. We believe that we offer users a way to remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page.
"E-mail song in the future" policy
Our site users may choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents to someone else. The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient.
Polling
We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. 1HappyBirthday may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question.
Surveys
1HappyBirthday may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners.
Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.

As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing.
We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas.  And to judge how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.
