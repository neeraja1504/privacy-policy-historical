17hats
This Privacy Policy describes how 17hats collects and uses the personal information of users of the 17hats service (the "Service") and website.
The privacy of your data is very important to us. Weâ€™ll only ever access your account if we need to assist you with a problem or to resolve a software bug.
The information we collect
We may collect your name, company name, postal address, email address, phone number, password, or other information you directly give us on our Service.
We automatically log information about you and your computer. For example, when visiting our Service, we may log your computer operating system type, browser type, browser language, the website you visited before browsing to our Service, pages you viewed, how long you spent on a page, access times, Internet protocol (IP) address and information about your use of and actions on our Service. This is done to measure and improve the performance of our Service.
We may log information using "cookies." Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive by a website. Cookies help us make our Service and your visit better. We use cookies to see which parts of our Service people use and like and to count visits to our Service. (And yep, we still find the use of the word "cookies" kind of adorable.)
We may log information using digital images called Web beacons on our Service or in our emails. We use Web beacons to manage cookies, count visits, and to learn what marketing works and what does not. We also use Web Beacons to tell if you open or act on our emails. Again, this is done to measure and improve the performance of our Service. Nothing more.
17hats uses third parties to gather End User's data from financial institutions. By using our service, you grant our third-party provider the right, power, and authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your personal and financial information from the relevant financial institution according to terms of our third-party provider's privacy policy.
When you write in to our support team, we use a third party service to hold onto these conversations, along with your email address or phone number for future support correspondence.
How we use your information
We use your personal information as follows:
to operate, maintain, and improve our sites, products, and services.

Security of your personal and customer information
We take the security of your personal and customer information very seriously, and so we follow industry-standard protocols to protect it.

Your connection to our site is encrypted and authenticated, using:

ECDHE_RSA with P-256 (a strong key exchange)
a strong AES_128_GCM cipher
We never share your personal information
Your personal information is yours, and we deeply respect that! We will never sell your data to anyone, ever, period. Aside from the highly-specific and highly-controlled situations in the next two sections below, we will also never share your data with anyone.
