If you are from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.
You can edit your communication preferences at any time. See Controlling Your Personal Information below.
Sharing Your Personal Information
We may share your personal information with third parties for the purposes of operating our business, selling, delivering and improving our Solutions and Services, sending marketing and other communications related to our business, and for other legitimate purposes permitted by applicable law or otherwise with your consent.
We may share personal information in the following ways:
Within ThoughtSpot and any of our global subsidiaries. These companies will use your personal information in the same way as we can under this Privacy Statement.
With third party vendors, consultants and other service providers that perform services on our behalf. Examples include, but are not limited to: processing of orders and credit card transactions, hosting websites, hosting Event registration, assisting with sales-related efforts or post-sales support, recruitment and human resources, and providing customer support or Services.
In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, consolidation or restructuring, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by or to another company.
In response to a request for information by a competent authority if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or is otherwise required by, any applicable law, regulation or legal process.
With law enforcement officials, government authorities, or other third parties as necessary to comply with legal process or meet national security requirements; protect the rights, property, or safety of ThoughtSpot, its business partners, you, or others; or as otherwise required by applicable law.
In aggregated, anonymized, or de-identified form which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.
We do not sell, rent or trade information collected through the Website with third parties for their promotional purposes.
Mobile Applications
We may obtain additional information through Mobile Applications that you download to your mobile device (“Device”). “Mobile Applications” means applications downloaded by an authorized user of our mobile software application to a mobile device. Mobile Applications we provide may obtain, collect or access information from your Device in connection with your use of the Solutions, and are designed to interoperate with the Solutions; for instance, to provide you with access to information within the Solutions.
In order to provide and operate the Mobile Applications, we need certain information from you. For example, we ask you to provide some personal information, such as login credentials to access and use the Solutions through the Mobile Applications. We may only be able to collect or access this information if the Device settings allow it, so you should always review our Mobile Applications settings under the Device settings menu to determine the access restrictions for the Mobile Applications. The Mobile Applications also provide location information to us by way of the internet protocol addresses from which you access the Mobile Applications.
Our Mobile Applications may also provide us with information regarding your Device, such as the Device model, manufacturer, and operating system. We may also collect Device event information, such as error logs and crashes related to our Mobile Applications, which allows us to provide a better experience to you. In addition, we may use information collected by our Mobile Applications to enforce our rights arising from contracts we enter into with you.
In addition, to provide this Mobile Application, we work with our group companies and certain partners and service providers who may have access to your information.
Security of Your Personal Information
We implement physical, administrative, and technical safeguards designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We also contractually require that our suppliers protect such information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. However, you should know that no company, including ThoughtSpot, can fully eliminate security risks associated with personal information. Further, the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personal information you provide to us.
Retention of Your Personal Information
We will retain your personal information as needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. We will retain and use your personal information as necessary to comply with our business requirements, legal obligations, resolve disputes, protect our assets, and enforce our agreements. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete it, anonymize it or securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Controlling Your Personal Information
Our marketing emails permit you to "opt-out" of or “unsubscribe” from receiving further marketing emails. Certain jurisdictions, for example the European Economic Area (“EEA”), provide their residents certain privacy rights under applicable law, including the right to object to or restrict the processing of personal information, to transfer personal information (data portability), or to request that we correct any inaccuracies or otherwise update your personal information.
You may send us an e mail at privacy@thoughtspot.com to exercise your rights or contact us as further described below (How to Contact Us). We will respond to such requests in accordance with the requirements of applicable data protection laws. Please note that in order to fulfil your request, we may need you to provide certain information to verify your identity.
These choices do not apply to service notifications or other required communications that are considered part of the Solutions, which you may receive periodically unless you stop using or cancel the Solution in accordance with its terms and conditions. Moreover, certain personal information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances, which may include circumstances where we need to keep processing your personal information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation.
Event registrants and attendees may update their user profiles for Events we host by logging into the applicable event website or registration page.
Cookies and Web Beacons
Like many websites, ThoughtSpot uses automatic data collection tools, such as cookies, embedded web links, and web beacons. “Cookies” are small text files that we and others may place in users' computer browsers to store their preferences. "Web beacons" or “pixel tags” are small pieces of code placed on a web page or within the body of an email to monitor the behavior and collect data about the users viewing a web page or viewing or opening an email.
While ThoughtSpot attempts to honor do not track (“DNT”) instructions we receive from a user’s browser, we cannot guarantee that ThoughtSpot will always respond to such signals, in part, because of the lack of common industry standard for DNT technology. We continue to monitor developments in DNT technology and stay apprised of DNT industry standards as they evolve.
For more information about the cookies and related technology we use on our Websites, please refer to our Cookie Policy.
International Data Transfer
ThoughtSpot stores and processes any information collected in in: (i) any country where we have facilities, (ii) any country in which we engage service providers; or (iii) any country where Events are held. A list of ThoughtSpot global offices is available here.
If you are a user from the EEA, we will protect your personal information when it is transferred outside of the EEA by:
Processing it in a territory which the European Commission has determined provides an adequate level of protection for personal information; or
Otherwise implementing appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information, including through the use of Standard Contractual Clauses or another lawful transfer mechanism approved by the European Commission.
If you require further information about our international transfers of personal information, please contact us using the contract details in the “How to Contact Us” section below.

Children's Privacy
ThoughtSpot does not knowingly collect personal information from children without appropriate parental or guardian consent. If you believe that we may have collected personal information from someone under the applicable age of consent in your country without proper consent, please let us know using the methods described in the How to Contact Us section and we will take appropriate measures to investigate and address the issue promptly.
