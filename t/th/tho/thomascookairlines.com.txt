Privacy & Cookies Policy - Thomas Cook Airlines
Our Company
Current:  Privacy & Cookies Policy
Privacy Policy and Information on Cookies
Thomas Cook Airlines understands and respects the importance of protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us, in respect of your relationship with us as a customer or a potential customer in respect of our flight seat sales and other related services.
This information can be collected via our website, Thomas Cook Airlines, (“Site”), our call centres, our retail stores, our mobile applications (“Apps”), our questionnaires/surveys, or our social media channels (collectively, our “Services”).
Please read the following information carefully. You are responsible for ensuring that the other people that you are acting on behalf of (such as those included with you on a booking), are aware of the content of this Privacy Policy and you have checked with them that they agree to their personal data being given to us to make a booking or other purchase on their behalf.
By making a booking or other purchase or otherwise giving your personal data to us, we will transfer, store or process it as set out below. We will take all reasonably necessary steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Thomas Cook Airlines is registered in the UK and is part of the Thomas Cook Group Airlines and the wider Thomas Cook Group that includes  ** a number of companies registered within the UK and overseas.  ** **This policy covers the Thomas Cook Airlines business.  **
Important: when you make a flight booking via this website, your payment will be processed by Thomas Cook Airlines Limited, but your contract will be with either Thomas Cook Airlines Limited or with our affiliated company, Thomas Cook Tour Operations Limited. This is because our website provides you with the opportunity to book your flights with Thomas Cook Airlines Limited, but also provides options to book with third party airlines, such as Condor Flugdienst GmbH, Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia A/S and Thomas Cook Airlines Balearics S.L.U.
When we say ‘we’ or ‘us’ in this Policy, we’re generally referring to the separate and distinct companies that make up Thomas Cook Group’s airline businesses. Therefore:
if your booking only consists of flights operated by Thomas Cook Airlines Limited, your contract will be with Thomas Cook Airlines Limited; and
if your booking includes a flight with a third party airline your contract will be with Thomas Cook Tour Operations Limited.
This Policy applies to personal data processed by the following companies, including data collected when you make bookings, purchases and enquiries with them:
Thomas Cook Airlines Limited – who are responsible for the operation of the Thomas Cook Airlines App, the Site, including managing your interaction with the Site through the ‘My Account’ area and who manage the airline telephone contact centres.
Thomas Cook Airlines Scandanavia A/S trading as Airshoppen – a Danish subsidiary company within the Thomas Cook Group and are responsible for operating our online duty free shop ‘Airshoppen’.
Condor Flugdienst GmbH - a German subsidiary company within the Thomas Cook Group who are responsible for the operation of some flights sold through the Site and through the website www.condor.com on behalf of Thomas Cook Airlines.
Whenever dealing with any of the Thomas Cook Group companies, the relevant company you correspond with or make your booking with will be the data controller in relation to the processing activities described below. A “data controller” is an organisation that decides why and how your personal information is processed.
Please note: except for the web pages available at www.thomascookairlines.com, all other parts of the websites operated by the Thomas Cook Group companies, including Thomas Cook Tour Operations Limited and Thomas Cook Money Ltd will be handled and used in ways mentioned in their privacy policies (not ours). You can view those policies here: thomascookairlines.com, thomascookmoney.com, thomascook.com, airtours.co.uk, club18-30.com and thomascooksport.com.
Additionally, Thomas Cook Airlines Limited sometimes needs to subcontract its services to other airlines, both within the Thomas Cook Group and outside of the Group. Please note where this happens, you will be informed and we will need to pass your personal information to the relevant airline that will operate your flight to enable them to process and deliver your booking. In this situation the relevant terms and conditions and privacy policy will apply of the company providing your flight (not ours).
We collect certain personal data about you and about any other person you include on your booking.  ** The sort of personal data we collect is information that you provide to us,  ** **that we collect from you or observe about you, or that we obtain from other sources.  **
Personal data you give to us
When you make a booking or other purchase or enquiry we will ask you for your title, full name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, date of birth, confirmation as to which passenger is the main contact and personal travel preferences. We need to collect this information in order to arrange the travel and other services you are requesting.
When you request to make a booking, we will ask you for personal data such as information concerning dietary requirements, medical conditions, disabilities and special requirements. We need to collect this information so as to be able to consider your particular needs in relation to a booking and, where those needs can be met, we have to share that data with our third party suppliers and transfer it outside the European Economic Area (EEA), as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not want to provide this information to us, or after you have provided us with this information you ask us or our data compliance department to stop processing this information, it will mean we won’t be able to provide all or parts of the services you have requested. If we need to cancel your booking/purchase as a result, you are likely to incur a cancellation charge. Advanced notice of any relevant charges and our intention to cancel your booking/ purchase will be given to enable you to make a decision on how to proceed.
When you book a flight via the Site, we will collect Advanced Passenger Information (“API”) which includes the following information for you and any other party in your booking: full name (as it appears on your passport), date of birth, gender, nationality, passport number and expiry and country of issue, and country of residence. This information is required in advance of flight departure to and from certain destinations, a full list can be found on our Flight Preparation webpage.
For flights to and from destinations which do not require API, this information assists us to streamline our check in process and could reduce queuing time at the airport. It also ensures we fulfil our legal requirements to share personal data with relevant customs and immigration authorities (“Relevant Authorities”).
When you make a purchase from our online duty free shop, Airshoppen, we will ask you for your title, full name, payment card details, booking information and email address. We need this information in order to process the sale for you.
If you enter a competition or promotion, complete a survey, or if you report a problem with any of our Services, we will collect your name and relevant contact information and any other personal information you choose to give us.
If you contact us online, we will keep a record of your e-mail or other correspondence, and if you call us by telephone, we will monitor and/or record phone conversations for training and customer service reasons.
If, when using our Services, or making a search on our website  you enter or provide any of your personal data (including telephone number or e-mail address), but do not make a booking or other purchase, we will keep and use the data you’ve provided for a limited time and purpose, as mentioned below.
To help us keep your information current, accurate and complete, please ensure you tell us if anything needs to be changed.
Personal data we collect and/or observe about you
Based on how you have used our Services in the past and your activity on our website, social media channels, or with our contact centre, we collect the following personal data about you:
Details of the services we have provided to you in the past, or you have recently booked with us, including your previous travel arrangements, such as flights  and other purchases, and matters related to those arrangements, such as details of your previous requirements or complaints.
We collect details of your visits to and within our Sites and Apps (including, but not limited to, searches, traffic data, website interaction, location data) this is required for our own purposes or otherwise, and of the resources that you access. We use third party technology services, such as Google Analytics to administer these services.
We collect details of some website(s) you visited before you use a link to our Sites, pages visited in our Sites, and time spent on each page.
We collect information about your computer (or mobile device/tablet) including, where available, your IP address, operating system, device location, browser type, cookie identification numbers, for system administration purposes, marketing purposes (both our own, and third party advertisers for whom we provide advertising services) and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and any reports we share do not identify any individuals.
We use Sessioncam for analysis. Sessioncam is a product that has been developed by Sessioncam Limited and record mouse clicks and movements, and page scrolling. The information collected does not include bank details or any sensitive personal data. Information collected by Sessioncam is for our internal use only and to improve our website usability and statistical reporting.
Personal data obtained from other sources
We might also receive your personal data from third party sources who collect information about you on our behalf. This includes:
If you book one of our flight seat sales through a third party travel agent, certain personal data (as applicable to your booking, such as your name, date of birth or any special requirements you have,
including any API) will be passed to us to provide you with the services you have requested/booked.
If you complete any of our customer feedback questionnaires/surveys, the information you provide will be processed on our behalf and provided to us by a third party such as clicktools.
If you book one of our flights through a third party agent, certain personal data such as your name, date of birth or any special requirements.
**Your personal data is held on a combination of our own systems and systems of the suppliers we use to provide our services.   **
When you give your personal data to us, some of the personal data you provide will need to be given to and processed and stored by relevant third parties and will also be shared with other companies within the Thomas Cook Group for the purposes of providing services to us or directly to you on our behalf, including the operation and maintenance of our Site, Apps and social media pages. These third parties can be categorised as follows:
our technology and data management partners who help us to administer the services we provide
our travel partners, such as third party airlines and airlines within the Thomas Cook Group Airlines, airports, insurance companies and ground handling agents (depending on the travel services you book), so that they can provide you with the arrangements and assistance you require.
our card payment facilitators, that help us process customer payments and assists us in  detecting and preventing fraudulent payments or bookings.
Some of these third parties are based outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Organisations that are based outside of the EEA are not subject to the same level of controls in regard to data protection as exist within the UK and the EEA. We aim only to transfer your data to third parties outside of the EEA where either:
your personal information will be subject to one or more appropriate safeguards set out in the law, if you’d like more information about our safeguards, please contact us. These safeguards might be the use of standard contractual clauses in a form approved by regulators, or having our suppliers sign up to an independent privacy scheme approved by regulators (like the US ‘Privacy Shield’ scheme); or
the transfer is necessary to enable your contract to be performed.
Due to the decision of the UK leaving the EU, the way your data is transferred from the UK to other countries may change to ensure continuing compliance with data protection regulations. This will depend on the data protection rules in placefor international transfers of data outside of the UK once the UK has left the EU. The security of your data will not change.
In order for you to travel overseas, we may be required to disclose certain of your personal data to government bodies or other authorities in the UK and in other countries, such as those responsible for immigration, border control, law enforcement, security and anti-terrorism.  Even if it is not mandatory for us to provide information to such authorities, we may exercise our discretion to assist them where appropriate in the interests of detecting and preventing criminal activity.
We may disclose your personal information to any member of our Group for business purposes including holding your data on central/ shared systems for delivering the Services to you and processing your booking. Our Group means our subsidiaries and our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries.  For example where you have booked a flight with a third party airline/carrier, your data will be passed to Thomas Cook Tour Operations Limited as the party who you are contracting and to the third party airline/carrier providing your flight (as applicable).
Thomas Cook Airlines Limited sometimes needs to subcontract its services to other airlines, some of which are within the Thomas Cook Group of Companies. In this situation it will be necessary to pass your data to the relevant airline that will operate your flight. In this situation their Terms and conditions and Privacy Policy will apply.
We may pass your data to relevant third parties, such as a payment facilitator Concardis  for the purpose of detecting and preventing fraudulent payments or bookings.
In order to provide our services to you, we use the information we hold in a number of different ways.
