1. "What information do you gather about me when I'm at your site and what do you do with it?"
The information we gather about you really depends upon what you do while you're at our site. Below are common activities and what we will ask of you.
Catalog Requests. We need a name and an address to send the catalog to. Plus a contact, either phone or e-mail, in case the address is wrong. To be removed from our mailing list at any time, call 800-216-7107.
Register to Win. We simply need an e-mail address and your home state.
Purchases. Your complete name, address, phone number, e-mail, and credit card information are necessary for purchase and delivery. Because most of our customers like to know that we received their order, we use your e-mail address to send you an order confirmation. We also use your e-mail address to let you know when we ship your order.
Because you have shown an interest in our products by registering, requesting a catalog or making a purchase, you may receive communications from us in the form of telephone contact, printed catalogs or e-mails with questions or information regarding orders you have placed and information about new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive any or all of these communications, please let us know. You can contact us by e-mail, phone, fax or in writing. Please provide us with your exact name, address, e-mail and phone number and let us know which communications you would like halted.
From time to time, we exchange names, and other personal information with other companies whose products, and services might interest you, but only with your consent. If you do not want to have your name or other personal information shared with other companies, you can contact us by e-mail, phone, fax or in writing.
We may also collect information available from third parties, including address verification services, and may combine that information with information collected from you, including information you enter when you place an order, and information collected passively using cookies or similar technology, as discussed in Sections 2 and 3 below. We will use this information in order to fulfill your order, market our products, or to provide you with a better experience.
We may from time to time contract with third party vendors to serve ads to our customers on our behalf across the Internet or to send our catalogs to customers whom we think may be interested in our products or services. To do this, the vendors will collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site and your interaction with our products and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a cookie or pixel ta - industry standard technology used by most major Web sites. No personally identifiable information is collected during your visit to our website, which may include your name and mailing address, for purposes of determining whether you might be interested in receiving a catalog.
2. "Do you keep track of me as I move through the Thompson Cigar site?"
For each visitor to our web site, our web server automatically recognizes only the visitor's domain name. We collect domain names and aggregate information on what pages visitors access or view. Essentially, our web site is an online store. As such, in order to better serve our customers, we need to know which pages they view and how they get there.

7. Is my credit card number secure?
We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) an industry standard encryption method to protect the private and personal information that you send to us through our web site. The encryption that we use on this web site is from GeoTrust, which is a leading provider of digital trust services that enable businesses and consumers to engage in commerce and communications with confidence.
Web browsers can operate in "normal" mode and in "secure" mode. You can tell which mode your browser is in by looking at the toolbar at the bottom of the browser window. If you see a broken key, or an open padlock, you are in normal mode. If the key is whole, or the padlock is closed, you are in "secure" mode.
8. How do I know if a Web site is secure?
In order to be accurate, we're going to get a bit detailed here. When buying something on the Internet, there are three things to check for:
Data you send is strongly encrypted.
The site you're doing business with is the site you think it is.
The site you're doing business with processes your credit card and address information in a safe and responsible manner.
Points 1 and 2 are taken care of by SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and a Digital Certificate. A digital certificate contains the name of a company, Web site (like web name here) or individual, along with a cryptographic key that can be used to encrypt information that must be sent to that individual. When your browser switches into secure mode, it asks the Web site to present its certificate. The browser decides whether or not it trusts the certificate by looking at who issued it. If the browser trusts the certificate, then it will encrypt all communications with that Web site, using the cryptographic key in the certificate.
9. An important note about debit and credit card transactions.
Your credit or debit card will not be charged until your item(s) is shipped, at which time we will email you tracking information. Before your item(s) is shipped, your debit or credit card statement will show what looks like a deduction from your account. Please note, these funds have not been deducted but are being reserved within your account to ensure your order can be processed. This is known as an "authorization hold" and typically lasts from 3-7 days (and may be longer), depending upon the policy of your bank.
