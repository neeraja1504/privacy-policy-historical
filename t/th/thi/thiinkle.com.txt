We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status.

Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences
You can edit your SaveHi.com Account Information at any time.
We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the SaveHi.com service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the SaveHi.com Newsletter, that are considered part of your SaveHi.com account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.
You can delete your SaveHi.com account by contacting us. Certain information might remain in our archived records even after your account has been deleted.
Account Password
The following information pertains to your password if one is issued. Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters and do not disclose your SaveHi.com password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account.

We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you.
Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.
Choice/Opt-out
Users who no longer wish to receive newsletters or promotional materials or have their information provided to third parties may opt to not receive such communications or have information shared by contacting us using the information below. We will comply with such requests as soon as is commercially practicable. Such compliance may involve batch processing and other processes that take 30 days or longer. If you opt not to receive such communications or allow us to share your information and then give your personal information to us again using a site or under other circumstances that permit us to use your information, we will regard your opt-out as rescinded.
In most cases, it is impractical for use to stop any other party to whom we have supplied your information from continuing to use the information and opting out will usually not stop others to whom we have provided your information from continuing to use it.
