The clause headings used below are for convenience of reading only (and are not to be used for interpretive purposes), but we hope they make navigating this Privacy Policy easier for Users (defined below).
Safeguarding the Personal Information (defined below) of our customers, visitors, and users (“ Users “, “ you “, or “ your “) is important to us and we recognise the responsibility you entrust us with when providing your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy details how your Personal Information is used by MakerBot both actively and passively, when you use the Site and/or Services. With this Privacy Policy (together with our Terms of Use) and any other documents or policies referred to therein) we wish to outline the basis on which any Personal Information we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed including, what information we may collect from you via the Site and/or the Services, how we may use such information, how we may disclose information provided by you to third parties and the use of “cookies” on the Site and by the Services.
Generally speaking, MakerBot receives information because:
You have provided it to us;
We collect it from you; and/or
Third parties we engage (such as data analytics providers) collect it from you on our behalf. This happens in cases where we use or deploy third party tracking technology, or where we otherwise give these third parties access to the Site, Software, and other technology. So where we describe below in section 4 (Information We Collect From You) the ways in which we collect information from you, you acknowledge that such collection may also be carried out by third parties.

We collect Personal Information and other non-personal information, such as Anonymous Information, from you in the following ways:

We collect information through server log files, but also by deploying tracking technologies within the Site and the Services, and we may also associate this information with your Company Account.

5.2 Cookies. In the interest of giving our Site an attractive appearance and in order to allow the use of certain functions, we use cookies on various pages of our Site. They consist of small text files that are stored on your computer. Most of these cookies used by us will be erased from your hard drive immediately after your browser session (so-called session cookies).
Other cookies remain saved to your computer’s hard drive and enable us to recognize your computer in the event of a later visit to our website (so-called persistent cookies). It is particularly these cookies that allow us to make our Site more user-friendly, effective and safe. Thanks to these files, for example, it is possible to display information specifically suited to your personal preferences on a certain webpage. These cookies will be erased automatically once the retention period expires.
The legal grounds for processing the cookie information consists of the execution of the agreement as well as of our rightful interest towards the safe and user-friendly presentation of our Site.
For the same reason, the Site use cookies to distinguish you from other Users. MakerBot may use a cookie file, which is stored on the browser or hard drive of your computer and/or your mobile telephone device, to obtain information about your general Internet usage by. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s and/or mobile telephone device’s hard drive. They help us to improve the Site and the Services, and to deliver a better and more personalised service.
They enable MakerBot:
to estimate MakerBot’s audience size and usage pattern and perform other analytics;
to store information about your preferences and so allow MakerBot to customise the Site and/or Services according to your individual interests;
to continually improve MakerBot’s services; and
to recognise you when you return to the Site.
You may block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of the Site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, MakerBot’s system will issue cookies when you log on to the Site and/or use the Services or our Software. You may wish to look at https://www.aboutcookies.org/ which has further information on cookies and how to manage them.
The help function in the menu of most browsers explains how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies, how to signal to your browser about the reception of a new cookie and also, how you can erase all collected cookies as well as how to block all future ones. We remind you however that, in the event of limited cookie settings on your computer, you may not be able to use all functions of our Site to the fullest extent possible.
5.3 Analysis Tools and Internet Technologies. The legal basis for the processing of your data along with collective analytical tools and internet technologies is our rightful interest towards an analysis of the activities on our website and Users’ behaviour on the Site, as well as our interest (and the interest of third parties) in the inclusion of personalized advertisement suited to your interests.
5.4  Google Analytics. This Site uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. (“ Google” ). Google Analytics makes use of so-called cookies as mentioned before, text files stored on your computer that allow an analysis of your use of the website. In principle, the information about your use of our website as displayed by the cookie is transferred to and stored on the Google server in the United States. We activated a so-called IP anonymization on this website, which means that Google shortens the IP addresses from within EU Member States or from other EEA treaty states before they are exported to the United States server. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address may be transferred to the United States Google server before it is shortened in the United States.
As instructed by this Site’s operator, Google will use the information for the purpose of analysing your use of our Site, to compose reports on the activities on our Site and to provide further services to the website’s operator related to the use of the website and the internet. The IP address that is transferred by your browser and that is shortened before storing for the purposes of Google Analytics will not be added to other Google data. You can prevent the storage of the cookies through the applicable settings of your browser software, however we remind you that, in certain instances, this may cause that you will not be able to use all functions of our Site to the fullest extent possible.
5.5  Retargeting. This website makes use of retargeting technologies that are administered by other operators. Through retargeting, users of our partners’ websites, who were interested in our Site and in our Services before, can be approached with personalized advertisements. Studies show that the inclusion of personalized advertisements that are related to people’s actual interests are more appealing to the user than advertisements without any personal connection. Through retargeting, the incorporation of advertisements is based on the analysis of cookies that display earlier user’s conduct. Of course, no personal information is stored in this process and, obviously, the use of retargeting technology occurs in compliance with the legal provisions on data protection. If you do not consent to this mode of advertisement, you can deactivate cookies and/or delete existent cookies through your browser settings. You can do so by following the instructions under “Cookies”. You can revoke the cookies-based analysis with altering consequences for the future by saving a cookie opt-out on your personal device in accordance with the aforementioned instructions.
5.6  More Internet Technologies. As mentioned before, this website collects and stores information on the visitors’ surfing conduct in an anonymized way, through the use of various internet technologies. This data is saved to your computer through cookies and enables us to analyse your anonymized surfing conduct, for instance: a user’s city of origin, the type of browser and operating system he or she uses and the pages he visited on the internet. This data can in no event be used to personally identify the visitor of our webpage. The stored data are only used to improve our product and service. Therefore, all IP addresses are shortened and thus processed in an anonymous way. It is not used in a different way or disclosed to third parties. You can generally revoke your consent for the collection, processing and the use of data by a analytics or retargeting technologies commissioned by this website, with altering consequences for the future. It will save a cookie opt-out to your device. This revocation will remain effective as long as you do not erase this cookie.
5.7 Click Stream Data. As you browse the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes called “clickstream” data, can be collected and stored by a web site’s server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use, the address of the web site from which you linked to the Site, and in some instances, your e-mail address. We may use clickstream data to determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Site and how they navigate through the Site. We will only use this information to improve the Site.
