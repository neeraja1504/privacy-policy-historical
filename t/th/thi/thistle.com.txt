Summary
This Privacy and Cookie Policy describes how we collect, use, share, store or otherwise process the information we hold about you.
Your personal information allows us to provide the products and services you have asked for, as well as enabling us to improve those products and services by understanding your interests and preferences. By understanding what you like (and what you don’t) we are able to personalise your experience, show relevant adverts and improve your stay.
Who we are
GLH Hotels Management (UK) Limited (“we”, “our”, “us”) is the data controller when you provide information to any of our brands, including: Thistle, Thistle Express, Amba Hotels, Every Hotels, Guoman Hotels.
Legal basis for using your information
All organisations need a legal reason to use your personal information, if they don’t have one, they can’t use it. There are a number of legal grounds that enable data processing. It’s quite complicated but below are the most relevant grounds you should be aware of.
With your consent (C)
There are some activities where we process personal information with your consent, which you are able to withdraw at any time, although if you do, we may not be able to provide the product or service you have requested. For example, where we want to send you marketing messages by email, we would ask your permission first and you could opt-out at any time. We will indicate in the Policy where we rely on consent.
To fulfil a contract (A)
We also process your personal information in order to fulfil a contract we have with you. For example, when you book a stay with us, we will process your information to administer that stay.
For a legitimate interest (LI)
Sometimes we may use your information to help achieve our business objectives but only where that activity doesn’t negatively affect your rights. For example, we might use your information to analyse occupancy rates of our hotels and adjust room rates.
To comply with legal obligations (LO)
There may be situations where we need to use your information to comply with legal obligations. For example, we are required by law to keep records of who is in our hotels in case there is an emergency, so we can make sure you’re safe.

We also receive information about you indirectly when you interact with us. For example, when you visit our websites or use our apps the devices you use may provide us with your general location (like which country or region you’re in), if you are using ad-blockers, and your IP address. We may also receive information from cookies and other technologies that are on your device or browser. For more information on our use of cookies, please see the section on cookies.
Travel agents and partners
We collect information about you when it is provided to us by third parties. This might include online travel agents, travel websites, and other partners. This could be when you make bookings, review your stay online, or where you interact with our anyone who promote our brands. You should always read the privacy policies of travel companies or other third parties you use, as they will use your information in accordance with their own privacy policies.
When you, or someone on your behalf, make a booking using travel agent, booking platform or other third party to use our services, they may pass us information about your booking, including information about anyone else on that booking. The same would be true where you use a third party to make enquiries about our products or services.
Where you interact with third parties who promote our services for us, these third parties may pass us your information.
When you post comments, reviews, or engage in discussions and polls about our products and services, we may receive this information from the platform you interacted with or from our partners who monitor how our brands are performing.
We may also obtain information about you from our partners and other companies that have your permission to share your information both online and offline, like insight providers.
Sometimes we may want to improve our products and services by getting a better understanding about our customers and their preferences. In these situations we may ask reputable insight providers to provide us information that may identify you. However, this would only be where you have specifically consented to that third party providing your information to us. Where we do receive information about you from other sources, we may combine it with information we already hold about you and use it in accordance with this Policy. We may receive updated information about you from organisations that provide services to you. For example, we might be updated if you move home so that we can keep our records up to date or receive updated bank details to ensure that you can continue to use our products and services. Alternatively, we may be updated if your flight is late, so that we can anticipate your arrival more accurately.

Profiling and preferences
We sometimes make decisions about what your interests are based on the way that you interact with us and the information we hold about you, this is called profiling. For example, if you regularly stay at a particular hotel or frequently choose a specific room or pillow type, then we might use this information improve your experience by pre-selecting certain features of your stay for you, so you don’t need to. Understanding your preferences and personalising your experience in this way allows us to deliver the very best service possible.
Do not track signals or browser/device settings Our websites are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals or browser/device settings.

In addition to sending you information about the products and services you use (product communications) and in-life communications while you stay with us, where we have your permission we may send you direct marketing communications about our products, services, events and offers, as well as those of our commercial partners that we think you’ll be interested in.
Direct marketing communications may be sent by post, email, telephone, SMS and MMS, through social media (such as Whatsapp, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook), messages including push notifications to your mobile devices, and via other electronic means such as when you visit our websites or use our apps. This may also include any websites and apps of our partners who are in our advertising networks.
We may send you direct marketing while you have an ongoing relationship with us and for a reasonable time after you have used one of or products or services.
You will be able to opt-out of direct marketing by following the instructions in the communications you receive or changing your device settings. Alternatively, where you have an account with us, you will be able to log-in and change your marketing preferences.
Product related communications and “in-life” updates
We may use your information to send you newsletters, bulletins, and other “in-life” communications (about your stay), and triggered communications where you make changes to your account or other information about products and services you have signed up for.
For example, we may send you email or text messages about an upcoming stay with us in order to help you plan your visit and give you the best experience possible. You’ll be able to opt-out of these.
Service communications will be sent to you regarding products and services you interact with. These are important messages relating to the products and services we provide to you.
Data matching and audience insights
Sometimes we may compare our customer database with our commercial customers or partners databases either directly with each other or by using an independent third party. This helps us understand if customers are on both databases, and allows us to plan joint marketing activities, and promotions. Additionally we may match databases for business planning/continuity purposes.
We may use marketing permissions we hold to contact those customers for promotions that relate to data matching exercises.
We will only share personal information for data matching purposes where we have an agreement in place with the commercial customer or partner. This ensures that they comply with their data protection obligations, protect the information we share and limit the use of any shared information.
We may provide commercial customers and partners with information about the effectiveness of campaigns they run and well as the potential reach of future campaigns by providing aggregated reports of customer segments. This is called audience insights and helps us plan promotions and other marketing campaigns. your personal information is not shared for this activity.
