The Green Head may give third party advertisers permission to set cookies for advertising, but The Green Head has no control over or access to such third party cookies.
WHAT CAN A COOKIE DO/NOT DO?
A cookie is an element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. This element of data is a piece of text, not a program.
