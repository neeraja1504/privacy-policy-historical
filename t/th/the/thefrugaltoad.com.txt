Requests for Approvals and Services from Third Party Service Providers
As noted above, we may share Your Information with Requested Service Providers when you use our Services to request an approval, services or information from one or more Third Parties (a “Request”). IF YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST, REQUESTED SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY WITH QUOTES VIA MAIL, TELEPHONE, TEXT MESSAGE, FAX, EMAIL AND OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION. YOU MAY RECEIVE TELEMARKETING CALLS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBMITTING A REQUEST THROUGH OUR SERVICES, EVEN IF YOU ARE ON THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY OR ANY OTHER DO NOT CALL REGISTRY.
If you are matched with Third Party Service Providers, you expressly consent to those Service Providers conducting any research necessary to provide you with quotes for your Request. Third Party Service Providers may need to share Your Information to conduct such research. As an example, if you request approval for a credit card, consumer reports may be ordered in connection with your application. Such reports may provide information that may assist in determining eligibility for insurance and the interest rate you may be charged for the card. Consumer reports may also be used for updates, renewal or extensions of this insurance. In addition, card issuers may use Third Parties in connection with the development of a “credit score” for you. If you do not want Third Party Service Providers to conduct necessary research to provide you with an approval for your Request, then you should not submit a Request.
Please note that if you submit a Request through our Services and we share Your Information as described above in connection with your Request, you will not have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of Your Information in connection with that Request.
Aggregation and De-Personalization
We may take Your Information and de-personalize it either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating Your Information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing Your Information). We reserve the right to share, loan, rent, sell, or otherwise disclose such information to Third Parties at any time, for any lawful purpose, without notice or compensation to you.
Sharing with Friends
If the Services contains any functionality allowing you to send content to a friend, then please be aware that: 1) we may display your email address to your friend; and 2) we may use information you provide about your friend to facilitate the communication and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We do not store this information, but use it for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.
Circumvention of Security Measures
When you enter sensitive information (such as last four digits of your social security number), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
We cannot ensure that Your Information will only be disclosed as described in this Privacy Policy. No method of transmission or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. Additionally, by way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose Your Information to the government or Third Parties under certain circumstances, or Third Parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary within this Privacy Policy, our or any other applicable agreement or policy, you use our Services at your own risk and we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect, that Your Information will always remain private. In the event that an unauthorized Third Party compromises our security measures, we will not be responsible for any damages directly or indirectly caused by an unauthorized Third Party’s ability to view, use or disseminate Your information.

Network Advertising
From time to time, we may participate in or use advertising networks, such as third-party advertising servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors and research firms. We may use these third-party advertising networks for marketing, advertising and promotional purposes, as well as to serve advertisements to you. Advertising networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make inferences about a consumer’s interests and preferences, which enables their computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted to the consumer’s specific interests. This practice is often referred to as “online behavioral advertising.” For example, a third-party advertising network might collect the type of Internet browser you use, the type of computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether or not you visit specific pages of a website, the location of your Internet Service Provider, the date and time of a visit to a website and other interactions between you and a website.
