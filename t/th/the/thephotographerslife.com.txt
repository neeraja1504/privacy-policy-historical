Privacy Policy - Great Escape Publishing
Privacy Policy
Great Escape Publishing takes individual privacy very seriously. We are also aware of the threats to your security and privacy on the Internet. Please take a few moments to review the steps that Great Escape Publishing takes to ensure your privacy and security while giving you the best possible customer service as you use our websites.
Ordering Online
Any data you submit to us through an online order form is transferred to us via a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption protocol, and is kept in databases that cannot be accessed from outside. In other words, any data you send us is encrypted, so in the unlikely event a hacker intercepts your data, it cannot be easily read. Our security mechanisms prevent access to our servers by anyone outside of the company.
Email
If you subscribe to The Right Way to Travel newsletter, or purchase any products from Great Escape Publishing, your name and email address will be placed in a database. As with all other personal information, only authorized employees of Great Escape Publishing ever have access to this data. This information is only used to distribute our newsletter, which is only distributed to those who voluntarily sign up for it. Subscribers can unsubscribe at any time. Instructions on how to unsubscribe are below. We do not share Great Escape Publishing email addresses or data with outside companies or third parties.
Great Escape Publishing does not sell or rent your email address to anyone. We may use your name and address to send you information on other Great Escape Publishing products that may suit your interests. And, although we disagree with it, we must turn over any pertinent information to any law enforcement agency that takes the proper steps to require it.
Any email you send to Great Escape Publishing is completely confidential. We will not add your name to our email list without your permission. For security reasons, if your inquiry is about one of your subscriptions, we may ask you to submit some additional information only to verify your identity. Remember, in this case we are only asking you to confirm information you have already given us.
If at any time you wish to be removed from our mailing list, please contact our Member Services department (details below).
Discussion Board
Members are welcome to participate in the Great Escape Publishing Discussion Board. Please note that submitting your email address or a URL is completely voluntary, and you do so at your own risk. While Great Escape Publishing does not harvest email addresses from the Discussion Board, there is nothing to prevent an unscrupulous company from doing so.
You must submit a name to submit a message to the Discussion Board, but it does not have to be your name; aliases are completely acceptable as long as they are unique and not meant to impersonate another person. If you feel someone is impersonating you on our Discussion Board, please contact us and we will take all necessary actions, including legal, to correct the matter.
We reserve the right to remove any messages from the Board which are advertisements to buy or sell securities, are unrelated ads for other products, which contain profanity, or are otherwise illegal. Ultimately, however, we cannot be held responsible for any claims made on our Discussion Board.
If you have any questions or comments you can reach us via our contact page or with the information below.
Unsubscribe Information
If you currently receive our newsletter, The Right Way to Travel , and wish to unsubscribe, there is an "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of every email we distribute. You can simply click the link and you will be removed from our mailing list. You can also email lori@greatescapepublishing.com and request that you would like to be removed from our mailing list. It will take 1 full week for all of our systems to update, so if you are still receiving the email several days after you unsubscribe, this is expected.
