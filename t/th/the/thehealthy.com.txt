Any new brands, publications, sites and services acquired by or created by the Company will also be included in our Family of Publications, unless otherwise specified. This Privacy Policy will tell you what information we collect when you visit the Service or order Company publications or other products and services we offer to you (whether you do so offline or online), how we use that information and what choices you have about how it is used. Some functions and services offered through the Service may have additional privacy statements that supplement this Privacy Policy. We urge you to read our entire Privacy Policy, and any applicable additional privacy statements, so that you will understand both our commitment to you and your privacy, and how you can participate in that commitment. Please note that unless otherwise indicated, this Privacy Policy does not cover any information that may be collected elsewhere, including without limitation through any third party website.
Collection of Personally Identifiable Information
Some functions and services offered through the Service require that you provide certain personally identifiable information (“PII”). We may also collect PII when, whether you do so offline or online, you order a subscription to a Company publication, order other products and services we offer to you, or furnish us with information relating to your order or account. PII that we may collect includes email address, name, postal address, telephone number, date of birth, credit card number or other account number. We may also collect other information about you that we associate with your PII such as your interests, preferences and demographics. For example, we may collect information about your interests in certain health, food and lifestyle topics. We collect this information for example, when you order a product, enter a contest or sweepstakes, request a catalog, or register for a mailing list. To the extent we combine information about your Service usage with PII, we will treat it as PII. However, to the extent we “de-identify” (i.e., removal or modification of personally identifiable elements or the extraction of non-personally identifiable elements, including through anonymization, pseudonymization and hashing) the information we do not consider it PII for purposes of this Privacy Policy and may, subject to applicable law, use and share it without limitation. We do not make any assurance that de-identified data is not capable of re-identification.
From time to time, we may make available certain applications for use on mobile or connected devices (each application, an “App”). The type of PII we collect will vary by App, but may include both precise and non-precise geolocation information for purposes such as to provide you with access to local service, offers and promotions relevant to the App (e.g., coupons for local stores). Each App may include its own privacy policy explaining how we collect PII (including geolocation information) when you use that App; if not, then this Privacy Policy will apply to the App. You should always read the applicable privacy policy before downloading the App.

Cookies, Web Beacons and Server Logs
Company, and third parties such as related Web hosting providers, and advertisers and ad serving and tracking companies, sometimes utilize “cookie” technology and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed (“Tracking Technologies”) on or in connection with the Service. Cookies are bits of data stored on your hard drive that contain no personally identifying information (but may associate a unique identifier with your device and/or collect information that is hashed or otherwise converted to non-PII). Not all Web browsers accept cookies, and those that do usually provide a preference or setting that allows you to refuse and remove most types of browser cookies. If your browser does not accept cookies, you may still enjoy the Service but not all features and functionality may work.
We may also use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control for videos, or display content based upon what you view on the Service to personalize your visit. Third party partners provide certain features on the Service and may display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, using Flash cookies to help track and store information about you. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser usually will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for certain Flash cookies click here.
We and third parties may collect information using Web beacons. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used on the Service or in our emails. We may use Web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, collect and share information that is hashed or otherwise converted to non-PII, and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.
Server logs capture certain non-personally identifying data (but do track device identifiers), such as the time and date of a Web visit or opening an email, the browser and operating system being used, and the Web URL a user linked from. This information may be used for various purposes, such as use in aggregate form to help us plan system enhancements when necessary and to provide content that is compatible with our visitors’ Web-browsing systems. We also collect information about keyword searches performed by visitors on the Service. We do not collect your name or email address as a result of using a search feature. We may keep logs of all words searched to help us learn what kinds of information Service visitors are seeking, and to improve our Service.
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context.  Like many online services, we currently do not alter our practices when the Service receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser.  To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you can visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com, but we are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party information. Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding their Tracking Technologies, such as is described above regarding analytics and Interest-based Advertising. One way to potentially identify cookies on our Service is to add the free Ghostery plug-in to your browser ( www.ghostery.com), which according to Ghostery will display for you traditional, browser-based cookies associated with the websites (but not mobile apps) you visit and privacy and opt-out policies and options of the parties operating those cookies.
Company participates in the Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op to better understand how you use our sites across various devices you use, and to deliver tailored promotions. Go to https://cross-device-privacy.adobe.com to learn more about how Adobe does this and to manage your choices relating to this linking of devices.
