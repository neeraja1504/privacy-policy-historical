Collection of Personal Information
We do not collect personally identifiable information about visitors except when visitors specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis. Such personally identifiable information may be gathered in registrations, applications, mobile applications, information requests, reservations, RSVPs, online purchases, online surveys, social media services and in some instances in the process of utilizing offers from our third party strategic partners and alliances.
We may use personally identifiable information for the following general purposes: contacting an account holder regarding account status, changes to the account agreement, discounts, promotions, products offered and other matters relevant to the service and/or the information collected. Additionally, we may share your information, whether individually or in the aggregate, with our subsidiaries and affiliates, and in certain cases with selected outside third party partners and alliances for marketing or promotional purposes or to improve the products or services offered by us and our subsidiaries and affiliates.
We value opinions and comments from our visitors and we may conduct online surveys or issue invitations for such. We also offer an online Guest Comment form (link to Contact Us page where form is located). These surveys are entirely optional for all website visitors. Usually the information from such surveys is aggregated and used for improving our products, services and operations and those of our subsidiaries and affiliates. In other cases, we will use the identifying information as a vehicle for responding to an individual question or comment.
Collection of Aggregated Information
Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise stated in the survey. We reserve the right to perform statistical analyses of visitors’ behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the website. We may provide aggregated data from these sources to third parties for purposes of research and evaluation.
Sharing of Personal Information with Our Third-Party Business Partners and Alliances
We may share your personal information with our business partners and alliances related to specific marketing efforts and purposes.
When we provide personal information to our third-party business partners and alliances, we require them to exercise reasonable care to protect your personal information and restrict the use of your personal information to the purposes for which it was provided to them. If you do not want us to share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes, you may opt-out of such sharing by notifying us in accordance with the “Opt-Out” section located below.
Disclosure of Information
Although you may request to Opt-Out of sharing personal information with third parties for marketing purposes (see Opt Out section below), we may still disclose personal information to third parties in our sole discretion in the following situations:
if you enroll in any of our Responsible Gaming exclusion programs;
for non-marketing purposes, such as processing and fulfilling reservations or purchases;
to the extent such disclosure is mandated to comply with a court order or with a subpoena, search warrant or other valid legal process;
to comply with requests of government or law enforcement entities or legal, regulatory or administrative requirements of other governmental authorities;
to protect and defend us, or our subsidiaries and affiliates, and all of their or our officers, directors, employees and agents in connection with any legal action, claim or dispute;
to satisfy any contractual obligation to indemnify our contractors, business partners or alliances, or other third parties in connection with any legal action, claim or dispute;
to enforce the Terms of Service or Use of any of our websites, applications or services;
to prevent imminent physical harm or threats to public safety;
to third-party vendors that perform functions such as credit card transactions;
to prevent fraud;
to engage in debt collection;
to keep your credit card on file for future purchases, unless you tell us not to;
to ensure minors do not unlawfully enter our facilities;
·otherwise with consent or in our discretion if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary or advisable.
Non-Personal Information
Even if you do not provide information to us, we may collect non-personal information about your use of our website, special promotions and other services.
Cookies and Web Beacons
Non-personal information (for example, domain names or e-mail and IP addresses) and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of our internet servers or at our discretion through the use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small text files we can use to recognize repeat visitors, facilitate a visitor's ongoing access to and use of the website, track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that can allow content and speed of access improvements and targeted offers. We do not link non-personal information from cookies to personally identifiable information without your permission and do not use cookies to collect or store personal information about you.
Cookies are not programs that download onto a visitor's system and damage files (such as, viruses or worms) or send information to third parties about websites visited (such as, spyware). Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the visitor that has no meaning outside the assigning website.
If a visitor does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the visitor to deny or accept the cookie feature. However, visitors should note that cookies may be necessary to provide them with certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information) available on our websites.
We may also use other standard Internet technologies, such as flash technologies, web beacons or pixel tags, and other similar technologies, to deliver or communicate with cookies and track your use of our websites. For example, we may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information obtained with such technology enables us to customize the services offered and measure the overall effectiveness of our online content, advertising campaigns, and the products and services we offer through the websites.
Targeted Advertising: How To Opt-Out
We may license technology to serve advertisements on our websites, mobile apps or related digital services, and within their content as that content is served across the Internet. In addition, we may use third party network advertisers to serve advertisements and third-party analytics vendors to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of our websites and related digital services and viewing of our content. We do not share personally identifiable information with these third parties, but ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or analytics service providers may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including usage information. We and our network advertisers may target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based on your visits to both our digital offerings and other web sites or digital services. We may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements.
If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information. To do so please visit the NAI Opt-Out Page: http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices. Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt out), you will still see advertisements while you are browsing online. However, the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests. Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.
While we take reasonable steps to protect the privacy of our online users, we cannot promise that the current limitations of our online applications or programming will address every browser setting or honor every personal browser preference.  In particular, our systems do not at this time have the necessary programming to honor “Do Not Track” or “DNT” browser signals. Please return to this privacy policy in future for further updates on this topic.
Security
We have in place certain commercially measurable technological and procedural security measures in an attempt to protect and safeguard the security of the personal information provided by our visitors. Strict measures will be taken to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, or dissemination of personal information. Despite these efforts, please understand that no system is perfect or can guarantee that unauthorized access or theft of data might not occur.
For features on our websites that require a login or password, it is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
