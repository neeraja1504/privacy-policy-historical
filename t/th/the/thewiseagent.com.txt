After a transaction, your Personal Information (credit cards, billing address, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.
The safety and security of your Personal Information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
