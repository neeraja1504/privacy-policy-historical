In the normal course of business, theeagle.com and The Eagle do not share reader information with anyone. We collect this information for the sole purpose of improving theeagle.com and providing more and better services to our readers.
The only times we will divulge a guest's personal information to a third party are:
• If we believe in good faith that the law requires such disclosure.

In the event theeagle.com contracts with an outside research firm, we may provide your contact information to the research firm to contact you regarding participation in surveys, focus groups or other research activities that will help us improve theeagle.comís products and services. The research firm will be bound by its contract with theeagle.com to use your information strictly for theeagle.com research purposes, to keep your information confidential, and to adequately secure or destroy its records of your information when the research is complete.

Cookies and howtheeagle.com uses them
A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred from a Web server through your browser and stored on the hard drive of your computer. The cookie contains your user name and password so that when you log on, the Web server recognizes you.
Some advertisers on theeagle.com may use their own cookies. When you click on an advertisement, visit an advertiser's Web site or make a purchase from an advertiser, that company may use cookies according to their own policies. Advertisers' cookies are not covered under theeagle.comís policy.
You do not have to permit the use of cookies. You can, through the options in your Web browser, choose to accept all cookies, choose to reject all cookies or choose to receive notification when a cookie is being delivered so that you can make a decision whether to accept each cookie on a case-by-case basis.

General statistical information
Visits to theeagle.com are monitored to gather statistical information, including the number of visits to the site, the pages visited, which domains visitors come from and the browsers used to visit the site. This data is accumulated at the aggregate level.
This statistical information enables us to evaluate the effectiveness of the services we provide, to monitor site performance and to make it easier for visitors to use the site.
How does theeagle.com use the information it gathers?
Information collected on theeagle.com, including traffic patterns and user behavior, is used primarily for the following purposes:
• Internal research. theeagle.com is continuously assessing how visitors use the site. This data assists us in making decisions about how to improve the site and to better serve our users. Research data are aggregated and do not include data about specific individuals. We may share aggregated research (but not individual user information) with our advertisers or business partners. Additionally, theeagle.com may use your information to contact you to ask for your participation in a focus group, survey, or some other type of research effort.
• To customize your experience on theeagle.com. As theeagle.com improves its service, it may offer users more opportunities to customize content and other aspects of the site. Information provided by you may be used to assist in the customization process, if you elect to participate in these features.
• To tailor advertising efforts. Most of the information and services available to you at theeagle.com are free. In order to continue providing services free of charge, theeagle.com sells advertising. Advertisers prefer to target their communication toward audiences who are most likely to be interested in their products. The information gathered on theeagle.com helps us advise advertisers in general terms about certain aspects of site visitors (e.g. how visitors use the site, general demographic attributes of visitors, usage patterns on various parts of our site, etc.). This information helps both advertisers and theeagle.com make better decisions about where to place advertising. No specific information about individual users is ever provided to advertisers. However, visitors who choose to conduct financial transactions with advertisers on theeagle.com may provide specific data to those advertisers during the process of their transactions. Additionally, any information provided during the purchase of theeagle.com or The Eagle products or services will result in the collection of certain information required to complete the transaction.
More specifically, here is howtheeagle.com may use information you provide:
• Email addresses. If you supply theeagle.com with your -mail address, either by registering on the site or by communicating with us via e-mail, we may, from time to time, send you information that we believe would be of interest to you via e-mail. This information may be from theeagle.com, the The Eagle, or from one of our quality advertisers. Note: If we send you email on behalf of another company, your information is never disclosed to that company. Rather, the company provides us with the information it wants to send, and we prepare and send the -mail directly to you. Your information never leaves our systems.
• Postal addresses. If you supply theeagle.com with your postal address, we may send you periodic mailings with information on new products, coming events, surveys or other research materials, or other information we think might be of interest to you.
• Telephone numbers. If you provide your telephone number, theeagle.com may call you regarding orders you have placed online, to tell you about new products, services, or coming events, or to offer other information that may interest you. Additionally, theeagle.com, the The Bryan-College Station Eagle or one of their agents may call you for research purposes.
