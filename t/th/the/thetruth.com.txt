Privacy and Terms of Service | truth
HERE COMES A LOT OF LEGAL  MUMBO JUMBO. SO, EVEN IF YOU’RE BORED TO TEARS, READ IT AND THEN CHECK OUT THE REST OF OUR WEBSITE.
Privacy Policy
www.thetruth.com is a website of Truth Initiative, which is dedicated to achieving a culture where all youth and young adults reject tobacco.  We respect your privacy and have created this Privacy Policy to explain what information we collect through the website and how we use it.  If you have any questions about this policy, please contact us.
Non-Personally Identifiable User Information
We automatically collect non-personally identifiable information about our site’s users, including the domain name and IP address of visitors, the browser and operating system used, the date and time of each visit and the source of referral.  This information does not identify individual visitors, and it is used for our own research purposes and to improve the site’s content, structure, and security.
Cookies
Cookies are information files that allow websites to remember users’ activities on a website.  When you visit our site, we may send one or more cookies to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser.  We use the information we learn from cookies to improve the quality of our service, for example, by tracking user trends.  We do not use cookies to track user activity on an individual basis. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, some of our features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
Personally Identifiable Information
We collect personally identifiable information from you through the site (such as your name, mailing address or email address) when you choose to sign up for our newsletter or otherwise voluntarily provide such information to us. We use your personally identifiable information to create a customized digital experience through the various truth platforms, for analytics, personalization and tracking, and for the purpose for which it was provided, (for example, to add you to our newsletter distribution list, to respond to a query or to fulfill a purchase of truth® merch). If you provide us with your email address, we may begin sending you emails with information that we think will be of interest to you. If, at any time, you wish to stop receiving emails from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of any email you receive. If you provide your cell phone number to us, you consent to receive autodialed messages and texts at that number on any subject from us, unless and until you request that such messages stop.
We also use personal information about users to our website to better understand how people use our site so that we can improve the website and its offerings.
Unfortunately, given the complexity of privacy regulations outside the United States, we do not profile, personalize, track or create customized digital experience for IP addresses that appear to come from outside the United States.  As a result, you may not have the benefit of full digital platform experience.
Security
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or disclosure or destruction of our users' data.  We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to perform their jobs. Nonetheless, we cannot guarantee that your information is 100% secure.
Sharing Personal Information
We may share your personal information with other like-minded organizations, government officials or other policy-makers, or the press if we believe it will help advance our mission of achieving a culture where all youth and young adults reject tobacco and drugs.
We may also share your information if you provide the information in a context where you would expect the information to be shared.  For instance, if you choose to sign a truth-sponsored petition with your name and email address, we may share that information with the party receiving the petition.  We may use third party service providers to help us operate our website or administer activities on our behalf. Examples may include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, removing repetitive information from customer lists, processing credit card payments and providing customer service.   We may share personal information about our users with these third parties for those limited purposes, but we require that such third parties protect the confidentiality of user information and use it for no other purpose.
In addition, we will share personally identifiable information about our users when required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or to respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. We will also share personally identifiable information if we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property and safety of us or others.
We may also share personally identifiable information in connection with, or during negotiations of, a merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another entity. Moreover, we may share personally identifiable information about a user upon the user’s consent.
We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personally identifiable information regarding our website users with third parties.
Third Party Websites
We may reference mobile applications (“apps”) or provide links from our website to other websites. We do not control the content or links that appear on these third party websites/apps, and we are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or references to apps from our site.  For instance, these other websites/apps may use cookies or other methods to track and profile people.  These third-party websites and services have their own privacy policies.  Browsing and interaction on any other website and/or app, including websites that have a link to or apps referenced from our site, is subject to that website’s/app’s own terms and policies.  This Privacy Policy covers only information collected through the use of this website. In addition, we do not currently respond to web browser “do not track” signals.
Adobe Cloud Marketing Coop
Truth Initiative participates in the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op to better understand how you use our website and apps across the various devices you use, and to deliver tailored promotions and communications. Learn more at https://cross-device-privacy.adobe.com about how Adobe does this.
Compliance with Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
Protecting the privacy of the young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect information at the website from those we know are under 13, and no part of the website is structured to attract anyone under 13. If we become aware of having information about anyone under 13, we will promptly delete the information, unless we obtain consent from the parent or legal guardian of the child to retain such information.
SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR THIS IS QUITTING PROGRAM
We are excited that you have decided to use This is Quitting to achieve your vaping cessation goals.  We are constantly trying to improve our web and mobile tools to help people quit vaping. To further that goal, we collect data about your use of This is Quitting services (e.g., number and frequency of program use, the content of your texts, etc.).
Data collected from the program may be used for public health and research purposes to help us build better tools for quitting smoking or vaping.
When you sign up for This is Quitting, you are agreeing that at a later date, we may send you communications and content about other Truth Initiative programs, initiatives, campaigns and messaging.  You may unsubscribe to these communications at any time.
We may share with other third-party research partners or sponsoring organizations certain aggregated, de-identified data collected from users without their consent. Such information will not include any personally identifiable information such as your name or phone number.
Information provided as part of This is Quitting does not constitute medical advice. This is Quitting services are not to be used to make diagnoses, prescribe medicine or provide treatment, and should not be relied upon as a substitute for consultations with qualified health professionals who are familiar with your individual medical needs. The This is Quitting program is provided as a self-help service to provide you with support while quitting vaping. Please contact your health care provider with any concerns about your physical or mental health or about whether this program is or is not working for you. We do not promise or guarantee any outcome, including that you will successfully quit vaping.
For versions of This is Quitting offered through a school, healthcare system, public health organization or other sponsoring entity (each, a "Sponsoring Entity"), we may share aggregated, de-identified data about your use of This is Quitting with such Sponsoring Entity.

We encourage our website users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about what information we collect and how we use that information.
