Scope
This privacy policy applies to personal information collected by SBS in respect of which SBS, as an Australian government agency, must comply with the 11 Information Privacy Principles (IPPs) in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act).
SBS's program material is exempt from the Privacy Act (see 'Privacy and SBS program material' below).
The IPPs regulate how personal information is collected, stored and maintained, how it can be accessed, and the way it is used and disclosed.
The IPPs can be accessed through the website of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.
'Personal information' is defined in the Privacy Act as 'information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database) whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion'.
Privacy and SBS program material
SBS's program material is exempt from the Privacy Act. The general purpose of this exemption, and the exemption for the acts and practices of private sector media organisations done in the course of journalism, is to allow for the free flow of information to the public.
SBS recognises the need to balance the rights of individuals to privacy and freedom of expression in its Codes of Practice, which set out the principles and policies it uses to guide its programming. Code 1.9 deals with privacy:
_ 1.9 Privacy
The rights of individuals to privacy should be respected in all SBS programs. However, in order to provide information to the public which relates to a person's performance of public duties or about other matters of public interest, intrusions upon privacy may, in some circumstances, be justified._
If you consider that SBS has breached the SBS Codes of Practice you may make a formal complaint to the SBS Ombudsman. To make a formal complaint you must follow the steps in Code 8 (see 'How to make a formal complaint').
The types of information SBS collects
SBS collects a wide range of personal information in the course of its operations including personal information contained in:
- employee records;
- applications from prospective employees and work experience students (see 'SBS Recruitment and Selection Privacy Statement' available from SBS and on the SBS Jobs website);
- audience correspondence and complaints;
- contacts lists;
- online registrations;
- email newsletter subscriptions;
- competition entry forms.
Collection
SBS only collects personal information for purposes that are directly related to its functions or activities under the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991.
When SBS collects personal information from you it will inform you of the reason the information is being collected and to whom it usually gives that kind of information. If the collection is authorised or required by law, SBS will inform you of that fact.
SBS takes steps to ensure that the personal information it collects is relevant to its purpose, up to date and complete. SBS will not intrude to an unreasonable extent upon the personal affairs of the individual concerned.

Personal information
SBS collects personal information that individuals provide to it via its website, such as in online subscription forms, competition entries and feedback to SBS. SBS will only use this personal information for the purpose for which it was provided to SBS.
Where an SBS website is produced in conjunction with a third party ('SBS Partner'), personal information submitted to that website may be recorded by either SBS or the SBS Partner. However, SBS imposes contractual restrictions equivalent to those imposed on SBS under the Privacy Act in respect of collection and use of personal information by such third parties.

- the individual concerned has consented;
- the individual concerned was made aware that such disclosure was likely;
- its use or disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to somebody's life or health;
- its use or disclosure is required or authorised by law;
- its use or disclosure is reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law or of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty, or for the protection of public revenue.
Information about the types of records kept by SBS
The SBS Personal Information Digest sets out the types of records of personal information it keeps, their purpose, the classes of individuals about whom the records are kept, the period for which they are kept, how they are stored, the persons entitled to have access to the personal information contained in them and the conditions under which they are entitled to that access, and how individuals can obtain access to the personal information.
