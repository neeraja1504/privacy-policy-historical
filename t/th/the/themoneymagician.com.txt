NukeDebt.com may use cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web Server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

4. USE OF WEB BEACONS OR GIF FILES NukeDebt.com's web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons – sometimes also called single-pixel gifs – that allow NukeDebt.com to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services.

Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or e-mail communications. These Web beacons may be used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or e-mail s and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and e-mail s bring you to our website and how you use the site.
