We may record which products you are interested in and which products you purchase, as well as customer traffic patterns and site use. To ensure that your credit, debit or charge card is not being used without your consent, we will validate name, address and other personal information supplied by you during the order process against appropriate third party databases. By accepting these terms and conditions you consent to such checks being made. In performing these checks personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of that information. You can rest assured that this is done only to confirm your identity, that a credit check is not performed and that your credit rating will be unaffected. By placing an order you are giving permission to pass on the necessary details to our nominated fulfiment partner to enable delivery of your order. In order to dispatch your order our nominated fulfiment partner will pass only the necessary data to the appropriate carrier for delivery & tracking and to provide customer support services to you and with an up to date, efficient, and reliable service. We use the latest security measures to protect your details when you shop with us.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. In order to complete your order we may need to disclose some of your information to our delivery partners. If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions and other agreements; or to protect our rights, property, or our safety or the safety of our customers, or others.
