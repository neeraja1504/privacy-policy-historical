Information we receive from other sources
We will combine this information with information you give to us and information we collect about you. We will use this information and the combined information for the purposes set out above (depending on the types of information we receive).
USING YOUR INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH DATA PROTECTION LAWS
Data protection laws require that we meet certain conditions before we are allowed to use your data in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. We take our responsibilities under data protection laws extremely seriously, including meeting these conditions. To use your personal data, we will rely on the following conditions, depending on the activities we are carrying out:
Compliance with legal obligations: As an entity established under the laws of England and Wales, The Jockey Club is obliged to comply with UK laws and guidance provided by UK regulatory bodies. In particular, we will need to process your personal information to verify your identity, in some circumstances establish your age, establish your source of funds for anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and fraud purposes, and to establish whether you have been barred from any of our venues or from using our Site due to objectionable behaviour. You will not be able to object to processing or ask for the deletion of your personal information insofar as it falls under this category.
Necessary for the entry into / performance of a contract: When you enter into a transaction with us, a contract between you and us will have been entered into. In order for us to fulfil our obligations under such contract (e.g. to allow you to purchase a ticket or membership from us), we will need to collect and process your personal information. Failure to provide the requisite personal information on sign-up and financial information on entering into the transaction or objecting to this type of processing/exercising your deletion rights will unfortunately mean we cannot provide our goods/services to you.
Consent: We may send you electronic marketing messages about us and our venues, events and offers where you have not unsubscribed and where you have purchased tickets to our venues or events or bought goods or other services from us. We provide easy ways to stop our marketing, and you can opt out at any time.
If you are not a customer of ours but have provided us with consent to use your details for marketing purposes, then we may also contact you about our events, goods and services.
If you have confirmed that you would like to hear from us about other party’s goods and services then we will use your details to contact you with marketing information about such party's goods and services.
If you have confirmed that you would like to hear directly from a third party (including other members of our Group) about such party’s goods and services then we will share your details with such third party so they can contact you about their goods and services.
In each of the situations above, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and can object to processing of this nature.
Legitimate interests: To use your personal data for any other purpose described in this Privacy Policy, we will rely on a condition known as "legitimate interests". It is in our legitimate interests to collect your personal data as it provides us with the information that we need to provide our services to you more effectively and to manage our business. Effectively, this requires us to carry out a balancing test of our interests in using your personal data (for example, in order to provide you with the information, products and services that you request from us), against the interests you have as a citizen and the rights you have under data protection laws (for example, to not have your data sold to third party marketing companies without your knowledge, or not store your personal data in insecure or unstable countries or regions). As a result of our balancing test, which is detailed below, we have determined, acting reasonably and considering the circumstances, that we are able to process your personal data in accordance with the data protection laws on the basis that we have a legitimate business interest.
We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data as: (a) We need the information to respond to your enquiries (and where relevant process your CV/ job application); (b) We need the information to be able to send you information; and (c) We would be unable to provide our products and/or services without processing your information.
Necessity: We consider that it is reasonable for us to process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests outlined above as we process your personal data only so far as is necessary for such purpose.
Impact: We consider that it is reasonable for us to process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests outlined above as it can be reasonably expected for us to process your personal information in this way for the purposes set out above. In most cases the information is being processed for your benefit as well as ours.
HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION FOR
When your data is no longer required for the purposes listed above, we will delete it within the periods set out below:
Where a customer has purchased a product or service .eg. a ticket, marketing consents will be refreshed after 5 years and data deleted after a further period of 12 months;
We may keep your personal information beyond 7 years, in transactional platforms to maintain transactional record completeness to enable us to retain the information we may require for legal, regulatory and anti-fraud purposes.
Where a subscriber (being an individual who has not purchased a ticket, but has subscribed to marketing), marketing consents will be refreshed after 24 months and data deleted after a further period of 12 months.
Marketing emails and other communications where possible will typically be deleted after 5 years;
Call recordings will typically be deleted after 24 months;
CCTV will typically be deleted after 90 days;
