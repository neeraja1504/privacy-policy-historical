Thee Shade Store collects data that you voluntarily provide on the Site through purchase transactions, the use of our "measure and install", "to the trade" or similar features, when you registration for an account, request a catalog, or check order status, or that you otherwise provide through phone, e-mail, website-based, chat, mail and fax interactions that you submit to us or provide to our sales associates through or in connection with the Site. The Shade Store Site may collect and store two types of information: "personal information" and "automatic information."
"Personal information" is personally identifiable information about you including, but not limited to, your name, company name, gender, billing address, shipping address, email address, telephone number, credit card information (however we do not store any such credit card information), date of birth or age, any designs or photographs you save or upload on the Site, any personal preferences you choose to provide, transaction details such as style, material, size, price, discount, date, company name, an assigned password to protect your privacy, and, with respect to trade accounts, your company website, and tax exemption certificate, among other things.
"Automatic information" is information that we may collect automatically when you interact with this Site, such as your IP address, the type of computer you use, and the web browser you use. Automatic information also includes "cookies" and "web beacons." A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Among other things, cookies provide a means for us to keep track of your online patterns and preferences. By understanding which areas of the Site you visit, cookies allow us to present information, products and services that are of personal interest. A cookie will not allow us to learn any personal information (such as your real name and address) that you have not otherwise disclosed. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can change your browser so that it will not automatically accept cookies. However, if you do so, it is possible that some portions of the Site may not function as intended. "Web beacons", also known as clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs, are small image files that we may place on web pages within this Site and within web-based email newsletters that we send. Working in conjunction with cookies, web beacons allow us to accurately count the number of unique users who have visited a specific web page and the number of times those web pages are displayed. We can also use web beacons to let us know how many people opened a web-based email newsletter.
We may associate automatic information with your personal information. In the event of such association, such automatic information will be considered personal information.
