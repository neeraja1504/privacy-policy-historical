Third-party services, analytics, and advertising
Our Services include hyperlinks to websites, locations, platforms, and/or services operated by third parties (collectively, " Third-Party Service(s) "). These Third-Party Services may use Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit personally identifying information from you.You may interact with content on our Services through social media sharing tools and other social media platforms and services we use (collectively, " Social Features "). Examples of Social Features include "liking" or "sharing" our content and otherwise connecting our Services to a Third-Party Service. You may also interact with content on our Services, such as comics and podcasts, through platforms that host or embed them through our Services. These Third-Party Services may share the information they collect with us. We do not control the information that these Third-Party Services collect when you use their tools, nor do we control how the third parties that operate the Third-Party Services use any information they collect. We encourage you to review their privacy policies before using their tools, which can be found at their respective sites. If you'd prefer that these Third-Party Services not collect information about the content you share and use, we suggest that you not use their tools. Also, if you post information on a Third-Party Service that references our Services (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with First Look in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with our Services. To help us understand how users are using our Services and to help us improve our Services, we may deploy our own analytics engine in addition to engaging third-party analytics Service Providers to collect aggregate information on our audience and how our audience uses our Services (for example, information on traffic to various pages within our Services). These Service Providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Services, compiling statistic reports on the Service's activity, and providing other services relating to Services activity and other internet usage. We may use services to provide shortened uniform resource locators (URLs: the "addresses" of individual web pages) so our content can be shared more easily. These services collect information as our shortened URLs are shared and clicked on and may make some of that information available to us.We may also engage and work with third parties to serve advertisements on the Services and/or on Third-Party Services. These third parties may use Tracking Technologies to tailor ads to your interests based on your browsing of the Services and elsewhere on the internet, sometimes referred to as "interest-based advertising" and "online behavioral advertising (" Interest-based Advertising "), which may include sending you an ad on a Third-Party Service after you have left the Services (i.e., "retargeting"). In addition, we may serve ads on third party services that are targeted to reach people on those services that are also identified on one of more of our data bases (" Matched List Ads "). This is done by matching common factors between our data bases and the data bases of Third Party Services. For instance, we may use such ad services offered by Facebook or Twitter. If we use Facebook to serve Matched List Ads on Facebook services, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of such a Facebook ad and find out how to opt-out with us from such list. If you opt-out from our Facebook Matched List Ads, we will remove the matching personally identifiable information from that list, however, this will not take effect immediately and if you have multiple emails or other accounts you may have to opt-out separately for each one. To opt-out of Matched List Ads on Twitter services, visit the DAA’s opt-out website and app as further specified in “Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies” below. We are not responsible for such third-party services' failure to comply with your or our opt-out instructions. To the extent we combine information from Third-Party Services with personally identifying information we collect directly from you on the Services, we will treat the combined information as personally identifying information under this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, the information collected and stored by third parties remains subject to their policies and practices, including whether they continue to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices on what is visible to others on Third-Party Services. We are not responsible for and make no representations regarding the policies or business practices of any third parties or Third-Party Services and encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. For further information on Tracking Technologies and your choices regarding them, please see "Information Collected Automatically" above and "Your Choices" below.

Tracking technologies generally
Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. However, if you don’t accept cookies, you won’t receive the benefits that cookies provide. For example, a cookie may enable you to resume a video you watched in a previous visit. Further, cookies may be necessary for services to work as intended, such as keeping you logged in to a secure part of our site. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Please be aware that your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, we do not monitor or take action with respect to "Do Not Track" signals or other mechanisms. For more information on "Do Not Track," visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
Analytics and advertising tracking technologies
You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies by third party analytics providers. To opt-out of Google Analytics tracking, visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout or download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. To opt-out of Parse.ly tracking, visit http://srv.config.parsely.com/optout. Other third party analytics providers may offer their own opt-outs.You may choose whether to receive Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt-outs.

To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices, and http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices for information on the DAA's opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (" NAI ").

Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt-out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). First Look is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In order to opt out of Interest-based Advertising under the Twitter Website Conversions Objective Beta Program, you must both (a) use the Do Not Track functionality in your web browser; and (b) follow the instructions at http://www.aboutads.info/choices, http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/, or any successor or related websites where users can access the interest-based opt-out mechanisms provided by the companies participating in such programs.
