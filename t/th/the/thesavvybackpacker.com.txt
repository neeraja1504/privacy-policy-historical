Advertising/Privacy Policy
For Our Readers
We respect our readers, and we believe in honesty and complete transparency. That said, we do often earn a small commission (usually between 1%-5%) when someone purchases a product/service through one of our referral links.
We NEVER recommend any product/service that we don’t believe in. We will always suggest the best/cheapest option even if it results in no financial gain for ourselves. This issue is very important to us.
We rarely accept products from companies. As of 2017, nearly every product we recommend and review on The Savvy Backpacker has been purchased with our own money.
Any products given to us will be clearly stated in the review and we always give our honest review (actually, if we don’t like the product we won’t even post about it because we only want to show you all the best travel products).
For Advertisers
The Savvy Backpacker is quickly becoming the premier resource for student and budget travelers planning their trips to Europe. Think you have a product or service that our readers will like? Email The Savvy Backpacker at savvybackpacker [at] gmail.com if you’re interested in setting up an advertising partnership with us.
_Important Note: We NEVER recommend product or service that we don’t believe in, and we will only accept partnerships with companies we believe to be worthwhile to our readers.  _
