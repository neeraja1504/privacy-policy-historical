For example, we are permitted by law to share information about you to agents, contractors, or affiliates of ours, who help us operate the website, conduct our business, or help us complete a service you requested. All such partners are bound to keep your information confidential. In certain circumstances, we may share information about you if we believe in good faith, that state or federal law requires us to do so, such as to comply with an inquiry from law enforcement officials, when ordered by a court, or by other compulsory legal process.

Below, you’ll find a few recommendations to help make your browsing experience more accessible:
If you have trouble seeing web pages, the US Social Security Administration offers these tips for optimizing your computer and browser to improve your online experience.
Use your computer to read web pages out loud
Use the keyboard to navigate screens
Increase text size
Magnify your screen
Change background and text colors
Make your mouse pointer more visible (Windows only)
If you are looking for mouse and keyboard alternatives , speech recognition software may help you navigate web pages and online services. This software allows the user to move focus around a web page or application screen through voice controls.
If you are deaf or hard of hearing, there are several accessibility features available to you.
Volume Controls
Your computer, tablet, or mobile device has volume control features. Each video and audio service has its own additional volume controls. Try adjusting both your device’s volume controls and your media players’ volume controls to optimize your listening experience.
Closed Captioning
Closed captioning provides a transcript for the audio track of a video presentation that is synchronized with the video and audio tracks. Captions are generally visually displayed over the video, which benefits people who are deaf and hard of hearing, and anyone who cannot hear the audio due to noisy environments. We do not currently have video content on our website. Learn how to turn captioning on and off in YouTube.
