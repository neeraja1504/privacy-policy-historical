How “Do Not Track” requests are handled

COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.
However, in order to comply with the GDPR, we have made the decision to up the age that is required by law here in the United States. We do not specifically market to children under the age of 18 years old.
