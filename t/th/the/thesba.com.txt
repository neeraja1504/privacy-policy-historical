Each visit to any Newtek page clicked after entering the Site enables the Newtek Family to collect:
your Internet service provider’s address

As part of providing you with Newtek Family products or services, the Newtek Family may obtain:
your name, social security number, company, address, email address, phone number, fax number, credit/debit card information, domain name;
employment information, income, credit references and other information needed in extending credit to you or otherwise transacting business with you;

Cookies used to customize the user experience and track visitor usage to and at the Site.
If registration is required to use resources contained within any Newtek Family Site, the required information will be gathered from you prior to allowing access to those resources.
When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information such as financial information, visitors to the Site will be redirected to a secure server and notified through a security icon that appears in the visitor’s browser. ****
4. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?
The Newtek Family collects, uses, discloses, transfers, and stores personal information when needed to provide services for operational and business purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.  The Newtek Family does not use personally identifiable information beyond what is necessary for fulfilling a customer transaction or for the basic functionality of an online service.
The Newtek Family may share your information (1) within the Newtek Family; (2) with third-party organizations that referred you to the Newtek Family (“Referral Sources”); (3) with service providers; (4) with joint marketing partners; and (5) with others to assist you and any Referral Sources in serving your needs in relation to the Newtek Family products and services, but only in circumstances where such sharing conforms to law, any applicable confidentiality agreements, and the Newtek Family members’ policies and practices, or for legal and routine business reasons.
Additionally, the Newtek Family may provide your information as required by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
comply with any federal and state laws, industry standards or with legal process served on any member of the Newtek Family;
provide to credit reporting agencies;
protect and defend the rights or property of the Newtek Family;
protect against fraud, money laundering and other risks; or
act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Newtek Family’s products or Services, the Site or the public.

The Newtek Family does not share personal consumer credit related information that is not public information with any person or entity other than other Newtek Family members, but it may share demographic information so that the Referral Sources, joint marketeers and service providers may analyze the impact they are having on the business community.
Links and Linked Internet Websites
Our Referral Sources and the other third parties with whom we may provide your information have their own privacy policies.  Additionally, any Sites may provide links to other sites.  These external sites may also have their own privacy provisions and security practices in place.  Newtek has no control over and is not responsible for the collection, use or disclosure of information collected by Referral Sources and other third parties.  We expressly disclaim any and all liability related to any collection, disclosure or use of such information from Referral Sources and other third parties.  You are encouraged to read the privacy policies of all internet sites you visit.
Notice to Insurance Consumer – Customers
If you are a consumer interested in insurance products, medical information and creditworthiness information about you may be collected in addition to the information described above.  Medical or creditworthiness information will only be used for the purpose of underwriting or administering your insurance.  Such medical or creditworthiness information is not shared with third parties other than potential insurance carriers.  This information will not be shared with any member of the Newtek Family without your express written consent, other than to the member that collects such information and the applicable member of the Newtek family that may be assisting you with the insurance products and/or services.
If you are a resident of California or Vermont, you will be provided with a privacy notice describing the applicable Newtek Family member(s)’s practices regarding the information collected about you in connection with an application for insurance, submission of a claim or other insurance transaction, how and with whom your personally identifiable information will be shared, and your right to restrict sharing.

We may use cookies to access or store information.  Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default.  If you prefer, you can block or delete cookies by changing your browser settings.
6. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?
Our servers are located in the United States.  We do not target users outside of the United States.  If you are accessing any Sites from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see “Will Your Information Be Shared With Anyone?” above), in the United States.
If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, the United States may not have data protection or other laws as comprehensive as those in your country.  We will however take all reasonable measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.
In addition, if you are a European Economic Area customer and prefer not to be tracked, or if you would like to request additional information on this Privacy Policy, please contact us.
7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
Your information is retained in accordance with Newtek’s and the other Newtek Family members’ document retention policies, which are reasonably designed to conform to applicable industry practices and applicable law.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
The Newtek Family maintains physical, electronic, and procedural security safeguards that are reasonable and appropriate.  Within the Newtek Family, your personally-identifiable data is stored in our password-controlled servers with limited access, accessible only by authorized Newtek Family personnel.
However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure.  Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from any Sites is at your own risk.  You should only access the services within a secure environment.  In the event of a data breach, you will be notified by phone, email or mail at the contact information you provided.
9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?
Newtek does not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age.  By using any Sites, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Site.  If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.  If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please contact us.
