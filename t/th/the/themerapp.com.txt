We also automatically receive and track certain data about your mobile device (such as your device-type and language preference) and we may create a unique device ID for you so we can recognize you. In some cases we can automatically detect your location data. If you connect with Facebook, Google, or another social network via the Themer app, we may also receive some data from that network (e.g. your Facebook ID, name, profile picture, gender, age, locale and email address).

3. #### Sharing data with third parties – key facts and how to opt-out
Third parties (such as companies who advertise through our apps) may require you to provide your personal data in order to access their products, adverts and offers. If you visit or register for a third party product, advert or offer, we may pass some data about your device to that third party (e.g. your tag history and country of registration) so that they can send you offers. However, we won't pass your email address or other contact details to these sorts of third parties without your permission.
Any third parties’ use of your personal data is governed by their own privacy policy (which should be accessible from their website or application). If you do not want third parties to be able to access or use your personal data, you should not register for, click on or use the applicable third party application or product.

5. #### Use of Cookies
Like most web sites and mobile applications, we use cookies to track site usage, to send you advertisements and to customize your experience of Themer. A cookie is a tiny text or graphics file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows us and/or our business partners to recognize you as a user. For more detail on how businesses use cookies on websites, please see www.allaboutcookies.org. You can find an overview of the various types of cookies used by Themer and/or our business partners, in the table below.

Performance | These cookies are used by us or our business partners to analyze how the Themer websites and apps are used and how they are performing. These cookies do not let us identify users (as all user data is aggregated). They are also used to monitor when you link from our app to one of our partner apps so that we can check what levels of traffic we are generating for our partner apps.

6. #### Sorry kids, over 13s only
We take our responsibilities to the online community very seriously. As such, if you are under the age of 13 we have to ask you not to use our apps or websites in any way. We don't knowingly collect data from anyone under the age of 13 and we do not direct any of our products or services at this age group. If we become aware that we have inadvertently captured any personal data about a person who is under 13 years of age, then we will take the appropriate steps to shut down the account of that person.

You can update your personal data through the Themer apps and you can ask us about what data we are holding by sending us an email. We will do our best to respond to your request (upon verification of your identity) within a reasonable period of time. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 also permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we disclosed their personal data (if any) for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the categories of data disclosed to those third parties. To make any sort of access request, please email or write to us using the details above.
