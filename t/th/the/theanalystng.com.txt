ADVERTISING CODE & GUIDELINES
The Proshare Advertising Code & Guidelines ("the Code") adopted by Proshare sets the criteria for acceptable advertising on all proshare suites/domains.
Created since 2009 to promote the professional application of best practice advertising guidelines for an investment portal, the Code is the cornerstone of our ethical application of self-regulation in the discharge of our responsibilities.
Administered by the board of directors, the Code is regularly updated to ensure it is current and keeps pace with consumer, regulatory and societal expectations. It contains 28 clauses that set the criteria for acceptable advertising that is truthful, fair and accurate.
More than that, it provides a clear-cut resolution of possible conflict of interest, role and opinion that may arise where journalists, analysts and researchers issue news, reports and opinion on entities previously, currently or proposing to advertise with, and on the proshare platform(s).
Proshare recognizes that when used professionally and fairly, online advertising provides the consumer/client with needed and useful information; and investors the basis to use such communication as they deem fit. Proshare therefore believes that online advertising for a market data firm should be patterned along the following guidelines:idelines:
The intent and connotation of the adverts placed would be to inform and never to discredit or unfairly attack competitors, competing products and services..
The advert would compare related or similar properties of the product or service dimension to dimension and feature to feature.
The identification promos for the advert would be for honest comparison purposes and not simply to upgrade by association.
In all cases, the advert would be supportive of its claims in its communication effect and purpose.
The advert by its very nature will not distort facts and by implication not convey to the consumer information that misrepresents the truth.
The advertisement would never use partial or insignificant results to cause improper conclusion for consumers.
The advertisement would be fairly and properly communicated but never in a manner or tone that reduces the objectives or philosophy of the organization.
Comparatives delivered through the use of testimonials would not imply that the testimonials are more than one individual's thoughts unless, that individual represents a sample of the majority view point.
Comparisons, if made would be significant in terms of value or usefulness of the product or service to the consumer.
Advertiser will promptly respond to any complaints by consumers/clients on a particular advert or campaign
Refunds will not be made for suspended or truncated campaigns. Proshare however may consider in rare cases saving the paid charges of such a campaign for another future campaign.
Conflict of Interest Disclosures
The advertising service is separate and distinct from the Independent Analyst Service rendered by Proshare; ensuring that advertising services do not conflict with the analyst's opinion.
The research analyst(s) are primarily responsible for the preparation and content of all or any identified portion of this research report hereby certifies that all of the views expressed herein accurately reflect their personal views about those issuer(s) or subject securities.
Each research analyst(s) also certify that no part of their compensation was, is, or will be, directly or indirectly, related to the specific recommendation(s) or view(s) expressed by that research analyst in any given report; unless otherwise disclosed.
In situations where Proshare is not satisfied that our arrangements to handle conflicts are sufficient to prevent a conflict from potentially harming your interests, we will disclose the nature and source of the conflict to you and if appropriate, obtain the permission of the advertiser to proceed with the service.
For further information on how we handle conflict of interest, see our policy below.
Creative Work /Technical Guidelines
All creative work and technical details including words, service propositions and deliverables carried on Proshare website are the sole responsibility of advertisers.
Proshare however reserves the right to reject or deny any claim it knows, believes or considers to be or appear as a misrepresentation of reality to the public's it serves.
Where Proshare agrees to use its competence to design, create and load adverts for and on behalf of advertisers, it does so with the client/advertisers acknowledgment of liability for the message(s) promoted.
Proshare website may contain links or references to other websites. Please be aware that Proshare does not control other websites and that our terms and conditions relating to third party websites apply here. We are not responsible for, nor do we endorse, the contents of these other websites. If you in any way rely on information obtained from any such websites, you do so at your own risk.
Approved 3rd Party Advertising & Ad Merchants
Currently Proshare does not have any affiliation with third party Ad merchants and do not carry adverts not directly sourced from clients that comply with the code.
By the nature of our service, we work with and through partners whom we support by promoting their businesses through mentions and hyperlinks. This is in no way an endorsement but a business courtesy we consider appropriate to reflect their commitment and application to providing high quality content for the site.
Generally, online social media resources are interactive tools that enable you to collaborate and share information with others. Social media resources include but are not limited to social networks, discussion boards, bulletin boards, blogs, wikis, and referral functions to share web site content and tools with a friend or colleague. Proshare deploys these resources and encourages users to sign up for them. We may share advertising on the site as may be deemed necessary to bring users into awareness of new developments in the market or promotional campaigns that they may benefit from..
Space Rental & Revolving Door Options
Our AD-Space Rental option allows advertisers to run multiple campaigns off the spaces provided for tenure-bound adverts at no extra cost. This is done to avoid a situation where advertisers are exploited for choosing to change their minds or seek to reduce their cost per space paid for.
The revolving door option signposts the process through which the AD manager manages adverts on the site in such a way as to ensure that advertisers are not giving undue preferences over the other for same services. Adverts are attached weights which are pre-approved by the management based on a model guiding the advert rates submitted to clients.
Commissions & Trade Discounts
Commissions are only approved for members of staff of Proshare and Ad Agencies duly appointed by Proshare - and supported by an agreement of service contract.
Proshare does not pay commissions to members of staff of client companies.
Trade discounts are as advised by the Business & Markets unit, approved by the board of directors and administered by the Finance function. It categorically recognizes three scenarios - repeat customers, cash-paying customers and partner advertisers who pay ahead for contracts of one year and more. The credit for the discount so granted is to the account of the advertising entity/client; and is reflected on invoices issued.
Links To Third-Party Websites
Proshare may provide links to third-party websites, including social networking websites. Since we do not control third-party sites and are not responsible for any information you may provide while on such sites, we encourage you to read the privacy policies on those websites before providing any of your information on such sites.

There may be various points when we provide services to you where our interests and or those of our staff conflict with your interests. Equally, your interests may occasionally compete with those of other clients.
Where we are aware, including being made aware, that we are faced with a situation of competing interests, we will undertake all reasonable steps to protect your interests and ensure your fair treatment, in line with the duties we owe you as our client.
Proshare has a policy in place to handle conflicts of interest so that we act with an appropriate degree of independence from our own interests when transacting with you or dealing on your behalf. The policy ensures that we identify, prevent and manage conflicts of interest, including ongoing monitoring of the effectiveness of the arrangements. The policy is regularly reviewed by senior management to ensure our arrangements remain robust and fit for purpose.
Some of the conflicts that could arise are shown below, we expect you to consent to us acting in these situations:
Examples of such situations include:
where we carry out business for and on behalf of other clients, partners and entities;
where we deal on your behalf through an associate or where an associate is otherwise receiving an agent's commission;
where we effect or arrange transactions in which we or an associate benefits from a commission, fee, mark-up or markdown and/or in respect of which we, or an associate, may also be remunerated by the counterparty to the transaction;
where we match your transaction with that of another client by acting on their behalf as agent as well as yours;
where we execute a transaction in circumstances where we have knowledge of other actual or potential transactions in the investment concerned;
where we or our associates are involved in or act in respect of a new issue, rights issue, takeover or any other transaction or have any other relationship with an issuer of investments which is relevant to investments in which we deal on your behalf or make recommendations
We will ensure that transactions into which we enter on your behalf are on terms that are not materially less favourable to you than if no potential conflict had existed.
When conducting business for you, we may receive from or pay to a third party commissions or other benefits in relation to that business. For any such commissions or benefits, we will ensure that these arrangements provide for an enhancement of the service to which they relate and that they do not prevent us from acting in your best interests.
For any business where you are introduced by a third party, we may have made a payment to the introducer or pay ongoing commissions. You may request details of these payments.
We provide a range of services and may possess information of a confidential or non-public nature which we are under a duty not to disclose or use for our own benefit or anyone else. We will therefore be unable to use this information on your behalf or disclose it to you. In providing our services under the Agreement, we are not obliged to disclose or take into consideration any information, fact or matter that disclosure of which would be a breach of a duty of confidentiality to any other person or result in a breach of any applicable law or regulation.
To help us serve you better, Proshare actively seeks and identifies quality relationships and joint venture engagements between service providers, operators, researchers, data owners, brands, broadcasters, publishers and independents to create original content for dissemination across our platforms.
Some of these relationships are paid for either as sponsorship packages or as barter arrangements that allow parties co-finance and share the exploitation rights to that content and its intellectual property.
