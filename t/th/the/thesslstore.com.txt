What is your legal basis for collecting personal data?
While we prefer to collect personal data on the basis of explicit content, we are also acting to fulfill a contract between our partners, the Certificates Authorities that issue digital certificates, and the end user or reseller purchasing them. Additionally, we conduct related marketing activities under the banner of our legitimate interests. For more information, feel free to email our Data Protection Officer..
Do you share personal data with anyone?
We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to inform service providers about services for which you have expressed an interest and requested additional information regarding that service. Any partners that we do share data with have signed binding data processing addendums that restrict their use of the data to only its intended (and documented) purposes. If you need a Data Processing Addendum with us, you can find it here.
We do not sell or transfer your personally identifiable information to third parties without your permission. We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive for tech support, customer service, refer-a-friend, email updates, and to send registered users their passwords.
These addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
We may release your information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also choose to release your information to other parties if we deem it necessary to protect our safety, rights, or property, or that of others.
Rapid Web Services, LLC accepts liability for all onward transfers of data to third parties.
How is the data stored? Where? What is guarding it?
In compliance with the GDPR, as well as state and local laws, The SSL Store™ and all of its undertakings store data in the United States using Amazon Web Services. We use a secure server and all supplied sensitive/financial data is transmitted via Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers' database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems. By law they are required to keep the information confidential.
After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.
The SSL Store™ Cookie Policy
Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser. Cookies enable the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.
We use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.
Live Chat and Customer Service
At certain points, if you are not logged in, you may be asked to supply personal information for the purpose of customer service. Here, as with all other data touchpoints, we take special care to protect your information, including the use of encrypted channels and servers. All live chat sessions and phone calls are recorded for training purposes. Chat occurs over a secure connection, via Fresh Desk. Logs are saved both by The SSL Store™ and FreshDesk, though they are never shared with any third party. The SSL Store™ has a GDPR-compliant joint controller agreement with FreshDesk that ensures confidentiality.
Your Right to be Forgotten
We extend the data rights provided by the GDPR to all our customers and clients. That means that you have the right to modify or delete the personal data we have collected about you. Typically, you can modify or delete the personal data we have stored on you by logging into your account on our website. Failing that, simply email our Data Protection Officer either requesting a copy of the information we have collected about you - which can then be revised and returned - or the deletion of it. We will handle the request within 72 hours.
