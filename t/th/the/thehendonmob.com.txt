Other Data Collection
Cookies
Like many other Services, The Hendon Mob may use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk or your mobile device for record-keeping purposes. The Service may send cookies to a computer or a mobile device when a user accesses or views a Service. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to personal information for purposes such as improving the quality of The Hendon Mob’s Service, tailoring recommendations to interests, and making the Service easier to use. Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies on your browser. Cookies can be disabled at any time by changing your web browser’s options to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the services, websites and/ or applications that you visit or use. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or functionalities of the Service.
Web Beacons
The Hendon Mob may allow ad networks, such as third party ad servers and ad agencies, to serve advertisements within our Services. We may also place web beacons for these companies within our pages. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these third parties can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.
Third Party Links; Sites
The Service may contain links to third parties’ services, websites or applications. The fact that the Service links to a third party’s service, website or application or presents a banner ad or other type of advertisement does not mean that The Hendon Mob endorses or authorizes that third party, nor is it a representation by The Hendon Mob of any affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site or application, including on an advertisement, you will leave The Hendon Mob site or Service you are visiting or application you are running and will go to the site or application linked to. These third party services, websites and applications may place their own cookies or other files on your computer or mobile device, and may collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites and applications follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. Because The Hendon Mob cannot control the activities of third parties, it cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and it cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as The Hendon Mob. You are therefore encouraged to read the privacy policies or statements of other services, websites and applications you visit before providing any personal information.
Disclosure of Information
You understand and agree that The Hendon Mob may be required to disclose personal information if required to do so by law, or if it is in The Hendon Mob’s unfettered belief that such disclosure is necessary to avoid liability, to comply with any legal or regulatory process, to protect the property and rights of The Hendon Mob or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity The Hendon Mob may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable. Note that The Hendon Mob is not required to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar governmental request that it may receive.
The Hendon Mob may also disclose information about you if it determines that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce the terms and conditions of the Service or to protect its operations or users. In the future, you accept that we may sell some or all of our assets. In such transactions, generally customer information is one of the transferred business assets. The Hendon Mob may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your personal information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy; in the event of a sale of our assets including our database, customer information will be transferred.

The removal fee must be paid in full and in advance before any removal request occurs.
Security
The Hendon Mob has made reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure.
