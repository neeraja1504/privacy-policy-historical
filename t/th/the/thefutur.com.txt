Unless you request that we delete information provided by you, we will maintain that information for a reasonable period of time in the event that you choose, in the future, to purchase our products or services.  For example, you may complete one of our courses, and not find an additional course to be of interest to you at present; however, we may introduce a course in the future in which you may wish to enroll.  By maintaining your information, we make the enrollment process easier, as well as allowing us to provide a history to you of courses in which you previously enrolled.
