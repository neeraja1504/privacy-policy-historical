Privacy Policy
1. Introduction
1.1. Effective Date. The effective date of this Privacy Policy is May 15, 2016.
1.2. Purpose. The Paper Mill Store, Inc. ("The Paper Mill Store" or " Company ") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of users of the The Paper Mill Store website, the The Paper Mill Store service, and any software applications made available by The Paper Mill Store, such as any mobile device application The Paper Mill Store makes available (together, the " Service "). The Paper Mill Store has published this " Privacy Policy " to show its commitment to fair information practices and to the protection of privacy.
1.3. Scope. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Service, and not to any websites or services of third parties (" Third Party Websites "), which may have data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. For additional information, see Section 11 (Third Party Websites) and Section 4.5 (Third Party Cookies and Advertising).
1.4. Separate Terms of Use. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have also read and understood, and agree to be bound by, both this Privacy Policy and The Paper Mill Store's separate Terms of Use document (the " Terms of Use "), which is incorporated by reference and made part of this Privacy Policy. The Terms of Use document is available at http://www.thepapermillstore.com/terms-and-conditions.
1.5.  No Permission Without Agreement. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have read and understood, and agree to the terms of, this Privacy Policy. If you do not understand or do not agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy, you must immediately cease using or accessing the Service.
2. Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy.
2.1. Each time you access the Service, the then-current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. Each time you use the Service, we recommend that you check the date of this Privacy Policy in Section 1.1 (Effective Date) and review any changes since the last time you used the Service.
2.2. Although most changes are likely to be minor, The Paper Mill Store reserves the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, update, change, or modify this Privacy Policy, simply by posting a new version on this page. Any such addition, update, or change will be effective immediately on posting. Unless The Paper Mill Store obtains your express consent, any revised Privacy Policy will apply only to information collected after the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy, and not to information collected under any earlier Privacy Policy.
3. Children's Privacy.
The Paper Mill Store does not solicit or knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If The Paper Mill Store obtains actual knowledge that it has collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, The Paper Mill Store will immediately delete such information from its database. Because The Paper Mill Store does not collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13, The Paper Mill Store has no such information to use or disclose to third parties. The Paper Mill Store has designed this Privacy Policy to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
4. Information Collection Practices.
4.1. Traffic Data. Like most website and mobile application operators, The Paper Mill Store automatically gathers information that web browsers automatically make available, including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) Internet domain names; (iii) types of devices accessing the Service; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Service (collectively " Traffic Data "). Traffic Data is anonymous information that is not meant to personally identify you.
4.2. Cookie Policy. " Cookies " are text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit or certain emails that you open. Cookies store a string of information on a user's computer or mobile device, which the user's web browser provides to the Service automatically each time it interacts with the Service. The purpose of Cookies is to identify the user as a unique user of the Service. The Paper Mill Store uses two types of Cookies: "first-party cookies" and "third-party cookies."
4.3. First Party Cookies. The Paper Mill Store uses first-party Cookies on the Service, for example the Google Analytics Cookie, for the following purposes: (1) to gather visitor and access information relevant to customizing the Service to your interests; and (2) to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the Service.
4.4. If you do not wish to have first-party Cookies placed on your computer or mobile device, you should set your web browser to refuse Cookies before accessing the Service. However, certain features of the Service may not function properly without the aid of Cookies. If you refuse Cookies, you assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality.
4.5. Third Party Cookies and Advertising.
4.5.1. Advertising on Third Party Websites. The Paper Mill Store may advertise on other Third Party Websites to you after you access the Service.
