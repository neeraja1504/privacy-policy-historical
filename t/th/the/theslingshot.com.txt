As part of theSlingshot service, your reporting on documents may be shared publicly and associated to the username you chose when signing up for the service. In addition, if you register on the site, your reporting and web page browsing history will be associated with the registration and personal data you provide and we will use that information to provide you with more targeted recommendations.

We use small text files stored on your web browser (otherwise known as cookies) for the purpose of better tailoring recommendations of content and sponsored recommendations of content to your preferences over time. We also use them in order to keep you logged in to theSlingshot service if you register with us. These cookies may include a unique anonymous identifier along with information about the particular type of content in which you have shown interest. We may use your web browsing information to try to show you specific recommendations of content and sponsored recommendations of content that we think will be of particular interest to you. We may combine information about your web browsing with those of other people who see theSlingshot in order to share trend information-always in aggregate and anonymously-- with 3rd parties. For instance, we may use it as part of an aggregated number to tell a prospective sponsor how many people in theSlingshot network visit Sports web sites each month.
If you click on a theSlingshot sponsored recommendation, the advertiser sponsoring the recommendation may cookie your web browser as well, in which case you will be subject to their privacy policy. Please note that you are subject to the privacy policies of each site you visit - if theSlingshot is installed on that site, you are subject both to our privacy policy and the policy of the web site owner. If you click on a theSlingshot link to visit a site where theSlingshot is not installed, you are subject only to that site's privacy policy while visiting that site, and not to ours.
