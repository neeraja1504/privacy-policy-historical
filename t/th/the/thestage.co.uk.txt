Privacy policy | The Stage
BY USING OUR WEBSITE YOU ACCEPT AND CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION, USE AND TRANSFER OF YOUR DATA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
In this Privacy Policy, “we”, “us”, “our” or “The Stage” means The Stage Media Company Limited. For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act), we are registered with the ICO with notification number Z3499412.
We take the protection of the privacy of persons visiting the www.thestage.co.uk website (the “Website” “our site”) seriously. This Privacy Policy explains what information we will collect about you, how we will use that information and the steps that we will take to ensure that it is kept secure. By using the Website you consent to us collecting and using information about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Introduction and applicable terms
This Privacy Policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.
The Stage Castings is an online casting service made available to the general public including performers, advertisers and agents through our website and is operated by us (“The Stage Castings”). Please note that in addition to the general terms set out below the specific terms set out at The Stage Castings apply to the collection, use and transfer of your data submitted to or connected with your use of The Stage Castings. If there is any conflict or ambiguity between these general terms and the specific terms, the later will override the former.
Why we collect your personal data
At the Website we collect different types of information about our users for three main reasons:
To help us to improve the services we offer.
To provide personalised services unique to individual users.
To use anonymous details about our users to sell appropriate advertising space on the site. This might mean showing an advertiser how many users we have on the site; it does not mean sharing an individual’s details with an advertiser. Where we collect registration information from an individual, we will never share that individual’s information with a third party, including an advertiser, without that user’s explicit permission.
We may collect information from you when you seek to use the Website’s StageTalk forum or if you wish to subscribe to The Stage’s newspaper. The information we collect from you enables us to verify the identity of people posting messages on StageTalk, moderate StageTalk and prevent inappropriate messages being posted on StageTalk. It also allows us to process subscription requests for The Stage’s newspaper and validate subscriber access to restricted parts of the website.
Where you seek to subscribe to The Stage’s newspaper, we may ask you to supply us with your credit card details. Your credit card details will be passed via a secure site to The Stage’s subscription fulfilment service provider.
Use of your personal data for marketing purposes
You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will inform you (for example before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at info@thestage.co.uk.
Our principles
We are absolutely committed to protecting your privacy. Our policy can be summarised in one sentence:  We will not share your information with others without your prior consent.
Notwithstanding the previous sentence , please see below paragraph 6 which sets out details of the disclosure to Pure Solo of your personal data as a consequence of you using the Pure Solo App, in circumstances where you access the Pure Solo App through The Stage Castings.
We have also established the following four guiding principles:

Otherwise, we will only share anonymous aggregate statistics about our users, sales and traffic patterns with our advertisers.
Should we elect to change our privacy policy we will post the changes here. Where the changes are significant, we may also choose to email all our registered users with the new details.
You have the right to request a copy of information about you that we hold, and to update such information and have any inaccuracies corrected. We will charge you a maximum of £10 for such requests. Please address such requests to us at  info@thestage.co.uk.
