External Links – Our site has several external links pointing to our partners, or the iPhone apps we post on our site might have links to other sites that might offer content that we have no control over.

Affiliated Links – We strive to be fully compliant with all FTC regulations pertaining to full disclosure to our readers. We work with VigLink and our Full Disclosure about our affiliate relationship can be found here.
Paid Reviews – We post reviews that we do not receive any compensation for, and we also post reviews that have been expedited for a fee or are part of a larger paid marketing package. That being said, we pride ourselves on our completely objective reviews. Our ratings are never influenced by whether or not a fee has been paid or if a review is part of a larger paid marketing package. Our reviewers are never told if an expedite fee has been paid or if a review is part of a larger paid marketing package. When any compensation has been received by us in connection with a review or press release we post the following note at the end of the post: “ A small expedite fee was paid to speed up the publication of this review.”
