Overview
At ThePaleoMom.com and ThePaleoMomConsulting.com (collectively, “we” or “us”), protecting your privacy and security is a top priority.  This privacy policy tells you how we use personal information collected at www.ThePaleoMom.com  and www.ThePaleoMomConsulting.com (collectively, the “Website”).  Please read this privacy policy before using the Website or submitting any personal information through the Website.   BY USING THE WEBSITE, WHETHER OR NOT YOU REGISTER, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT POSTED ON THE WEBSITE.  This Privacy Policy may be changed, but any changes will be posted and changes will only apply to activities and information on a going forward, not retroactive basis. You are encouraged to review the privacy policy whenever you visit the Website to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.

_ Traffic Data_
We reserve the right to gather certain generic information with respect to use of the Website, such as the number of unique visitors, the frequency with which they visit, and the areas on the Website that they favor. These statistics are very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use this type of data in aggregate, that is we look at the data on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. This data helps us determine the extent to which our members use certain parts of the Website, which, in turn, enables us to make it as appealing as possible. We may also provide statistical “ratings” about how our members collectively use the Website to Providers, advertisers, sponsors, affiliates, and other companies with which we do business (“Partners”). We do this so they, too, can understand how often people use their areas of the Website in order for them to provide you witcooh the best possible experience. These statistical ratings do not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any of our members.
We may collect and analyze traffic on the Website by keeping track of the IP addresses of our visitors. IP addresses are unique numeric identifiers that are assigned to each computer browser accessing the Internet. An IP address, by itself, cannot identify you personally. However, when combined with other information provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your IP address can be used to identify the computer originating a message.
We may store all Traffic Data and review postings indefinitely, even after “deletion,” and may archive such information elsewhere. We may store all information until you request that we modify or delete it, in which case we may still retain certain information for the reasons described in this Privacy Policy or in the Terms of Use.

Use Common Sense in All Your Online Activities
Any information that you may reveal in a review posting or other online discussion or forum is intentionally open to the public and is not in private. You should think carefully before disclosing any personally identifiable information in any public forum.
Even the best policy can’t protect your online privacy and security in all circumstances. Unscrupulous advertisers, hackers, and scam artists are constantly searching the Internet looking for new targets. Your best protection is to understand the limits to privacy on the Internet and use common sense in all of your on-line activities.
Be aware that e-mail is an inherently unsecure form of communication. Remember that third-parties are sometimes able to illegally intercept your unencrypted messages.
Anytime you visit a blog or post a message to an on-line bulletin board, your e-mail address can be accessed by advertisers looking to compile lists for unsolicited commercial e-mail (“ spam”). Be sure that you only disclose your e-mail address in circumstances in which it is safe to do so.
Beware of scams in which persons unknown to you request your personal information. Make sure you verify the identity of anyone asking for personal information. Always monitor your children’s on-line activities and educate them as to the rules for safe Internet use.
You must promptly notify us if your contact data is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will remove that contact data from your account and update our records accordingly.
Children’s privacy
Although the Website is available to general audiences, the website is not directed to children.  As per the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 6501, et seq. ), we do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from persons under the age of 13.
