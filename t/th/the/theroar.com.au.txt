By visiting The Roar, viewing our content and/or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.
What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
This Privacy Policy is part of The Roar’s Terms of Service and covers the treatment of user information, including Personally Identifiable Information (defined below), obtained by The Roar, including information obtained when you access or log in to The Roar, and/or register for content or events provided by The Roar.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that The Roar does not own or control, or to individuals whom The Roar does not employ or manage, including any of the third parties to which The Roar may disclose user information as set forth in this Policy.
What Types of User Information Does The Roar Obtain?

● Photo and/or video
● Demographic Information (e.g., age, gender, interests, and preferences)
● Activities or Content Viewed on The Roar
● Information Collected Automatically (detailed below)

In certain cases, we may request that you provide some of the Information identified above in order to obtain specific products or services (such as registering for a The Roar profile). If you choose not to provide the Information we request, you may still use The Roar, but you may be unable to access certain features or services.
When you register to receive any products or services from The Roar or provide information to The Roar in any other manner, you agree to provide only true, accurate, current and complete information. You agree that all information provide by you is owned by, or licensed to you and its disclosure will not breach any third party intellectual property rights.

The Roar may automatically receive and log certain types of information when you visit or interact with our websites, services, mobile applications or other products, including:
● Browser Information
● Operating System Information
● Mobile Device Information (e.g., device identifier, mobile operating system, etc.)

Information and vision collected for Club Roar
In the event that you have submitted a video or vision to Club Roar, The Roar will collect the following information as part of the submission.
● Name
● Email Address
● Postcode
● Club Name (optional)
● Facebook Link: Club Facebook page or URL (optional)
● Website Link: Club website or URL (optional)
● Date that the video was shot (optional)
● General description of the video (for contextual purposes)
Should you choose not to include the optional submission elements, the submission will still be accepted and used as per The Roar’s video submission T&Cs.
By including your email address in the submission of video or vision to Club Roar, you are agreeing to The Roar contacting you for marketing and promotional purposes. Should you wish to remove your email address from these communications, please let us know here.
By submitting video content to The Roar or Club Roar, you agree that:
● You own the copyright in all material submitted;
● You had authority to be on the premises where the footage was filmed, or express permission from the person with such authority;
● Nothing you submit is obscene, defamatory or otherwise inappropriate; and
● Nothing in the content submitted by you infringes the intellectual property rights of any third party
How requests for removal of content are administered
For content to be considered for removal, an individual must be uniquely identifiable by image, voice, full name, bank account number or private contact information (e.g. home address, email address).
We also take public interest, newsworthiness, and consent into account when determining if content should be removed for a privacy violation. The Roar reserves the right to make the final determination of whether a violation of its privacy guidelines has occurred.
What does uniquely identifiable mean?
To be considered uniquely identifiable, there must be enough information in the video that allows others to recognise you. Please note that just because you can identify yourself within the video, it does not mean you are uniquely identifiable to others. A first name without additional context or a fleeting image, for example, would not likely qualify as uniquely identifiable.
