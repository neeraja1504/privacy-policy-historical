PROMOTIONS.
This blog accepts forms of cash advertising, sponsorship, paid insertions or other forms of compensation.
The compensation received may influence the content selected to publish and the timing of that post. That content, advertising space or post will be identified as such within the guidelines of the FTC disclosure rules.
The views and opinions expressed on this blog are purely the bloggers’ own. Any product claim, statistic, quote or other representation about a product or service should be verified with the manufacturer, provider or party in question.
We won’t promote things we don’t believe in…it just is too hard to write something convincing in that case. We turn down more opportunities than we take because we know that our audience relies on our opinion and what we write about becomes a recommendation.
AFFILIATE LINKS.
We occasionally use affiliate links.  I might get a small commission if you purchase from my link.  There is no additional cost to you AT ALL.  I only provide information for products I believe in, purchase myself and feel comfortable promoting.  It’s not worth it to me to “make a quick buck.”  I want you to know that when I promote something it’s because I genuinely love it and use it.
This blog abides by word of mouth marketing standards. I believe in honesty of relationship, opinion and identity. The compensation received may influence the advertising content, topics or posts made in this blog. That content, advertising space or post will be clearly identified as paid or sponsored content.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
