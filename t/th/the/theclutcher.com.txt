Transcription of * *art. 13 Legislative Decree June 30, 2003, nr. 196  ** – **  Information sheet
The data subject as well as any entity from whom or which personal data is collected shall be preliminarily informed, either orally or in writing, as to:
the purposes and methods of the processing for which data is intended;
the mandatory or voluntary manner in which data is provided;
the consequences of failing to reply;
the entities or categories of entities to whom or which the data may be communicated or who/which may get to know the data in their capacity as data controllers or processors and the scope of dissemination of said data;
the rights stated in article 7;
the identification data concerning the data controller and, where designated, the data controller's representative in the State's territory pursuant to article 5. If several data processors have been designated by the data controller, at least one of them shall be referred to and either the site on the communications network or the mechanisms for easily accessing the updated list of data processors shall be specified. If a data processor has been designated to provide responses to data subjects in the event the rights stated in article 7 are exercised, this data processor shall be indicated.
The information as per paragraph 1 shall also contain the items referred to in specific provisions of this Code and may fail to include certain items if the latter are already known to the entity providing the data or their knowledge may effectively impair supervisory or control activities carried out by public bodies for purposes related to defence or State security or else for the prevention, suppression or detection of crimes.
The Guarantor may issue a provision to set simplified information procedures for public phone and information services.
Should personal data not be collected from the data subject, the information sheet as per paragraph 1, including the categories of processed data, shall be provided to the data subject when data is recorded or, when foreseen for their communication, no later than when the data is first communicated.
Paragraph 4 shall not apply when:
data is processed based on legal obligations or community regulations or norms;
data is processed to conduct the defence investigations stated in law 397 dated December 7, 2000 or, in any case, to establish or defend a legal claim provided that the data is exclusively processed for these purposes and for the period strictly necessary therefore:
providing the data subject with information involves an effort that the Guarantor deems manifestly disproportionate to the right to be protected in which case the Guarantor shall set suitable measures, if necessary, or if deemed impossible by the Guarantor.

Retail cookies: these are used to convey significant sales content to site users. The number of promotional message hits by the same user is managed with this type of cookie, simultaneously measuring our communication campaign effectiveness.
Site access and page navigation require the user and/or customer's acceptance of the use of different types of cookies: the customer thus provides consent when site cookies are entered and saved in the browser tool used and at their use for subsequent site access.
