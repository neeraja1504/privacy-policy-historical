Information we may collect from you
ThePrizeFinder is keen to ensure that the principals of our opt-in when your data is collected are clearly explained.

You may also receive marketing calls via automated voice broadcast over the telephone.
Some questions on our Registration Form and our own competitions are specific to our named sponsors, and by expressing a positive interest in their brand or products you are also agreeing to contact from them. By volunteering your phone number you are agreeing to telephone or SMS/MMS contact by these named sponsors. You may subsequently need to contact these named sponsor brands directly if in the future you decide to opt-out of further communication from these brands.
