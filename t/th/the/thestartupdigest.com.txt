Information automatically collected
We may automatically log information about you and your computer or mobile device when you access our Site. For example, we may log your computer or mobile device operating system name and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, browser language, screen resolution, the website you visited before browsing to our Site, pages you viewed, how long you spent on a page, access times and information about your use of and actions on our Site.

What are cookies and similar technologies?
We may collect personal information using “ cookies “. Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.
We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Site; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Site, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites or online services.
Pixel tags
We may also use technologies that function similarly to cookies called pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) to track the actions of users on our Site. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages. Pixel tags can be used, for example, to measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Site, so that we can better understand how users interact with our Site.
How we use cookies and similar technologies
Our Site may collect personal information using the following types of cookies and similar technologies and process that data for the purposes set out below:
Type of cookie
|
Purpose
---|---
Essential Cookies
|
These cookies and similar technologies are essential to provide you with services available through our Site and to enable you to use some of its features (e.g. to keep you logged in as you navigate between web pages). Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.
These cookies and similar technologies collect personal information, such as unique IDs, IP addresses, device information, OS/browser type, and other similar data, that are used to create information about traffic to our Site and how users use our Site. The information gathered may include the number of visitors to our Site, the websites that referred them to our Site, the pages they visited on our Site, what time of day they visited our Site, whether they have visited our Site before, and other similar information.
Analytics and Performance Cookies
|
We use this information to help operate our Site more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Site.
For example, we use Google Analytics to improve how our Site works, so that we can understand usage patterns on the Site, and similar purposes. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here and about how Google protects your data here. You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Site by downloading and installing the browser plugin available here. To learn more about other similar technologies we use and how you can opt out, you may contact us.
Social Media Cookies
|
These cookies and similar technologies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our Site or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook or Twitter. The social network will record that you have done this and may collect additional personal information about you, or link it to other personal information they hold about you, as described further by the social media service. Please see the applicable privacy policy for more detail.
Retargeting Interest-based Advertising
|
These cookies and similar technologies are used for “retargeting” and for interest-based advertising.
Interest-based advertising includes various parties and services providers, including third party data controllers, engaged in the processing of personal data in connection with personalized advertising. These parties may collect personal information such as unique IDs, IP addresses, device information, OS/browser type, and other similar data, as well as information about the ads you see and view to develop and assess aspects of a profile about you to deliver more relevant advertisements and offers, and determine whether and how ads you see are effective. These third parties may augment your profile with demographic and other preferences data derived from these observations, and may also track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether you complete a purchase for a good or services you were shown in an advertisement. These parties may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time.
We also use ad “retargeting” so that you can see advertisements from us on other websites. For example, we may share with Google certain personal information (such as unique user ID) in connection with advertising provided through Google’s “Customer Match” service. These technologies and the data they process may be used by advertisers to deliver ads on their services based on content you have viewed on our Sites, or that we believe you would be interested in, for example, based on Events you have attended or products/services you have purchased from us. These tracking technologies may also help prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, and help us understand whether you have interacted with or viewed ads we’ve delivered to you. This collection and ad targeting takes place both on our Sites and on third-party websites (e.g. Google) that participate in the ad network, e.g. any advertisements delivered by that ad network on a third party website.
To learn about the specific providers we use for these services, please contact us.
To provide the Services you request
If you use our Site, sign up for, or request to participate in a particular Service, we will process your personal information you give us or that we receive from relevant parties as necessary or appropriate for us to provide that Service. For example, we may process your personal information to:
operate, maintain, administer and improve our Site, e.g. to show the content you request, secure the Site, and understand how users interact with the Site;

If you request information from us, register on our Site, or participate in our surveys, promotions or events, where allowed by law, we or our third party partners, mentors, and members of the Techstars network may use your personal information, such as name and contact information, as well as information about your preferences or profile information, to send you updates, newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials, including communications that may be targeted to you based on your personal information, as permitted by law. We also may, from time to time, contact you about a particular offering that may be of interest to you based on publicly available information, or information obtained through the Techstars network, Events you’ve attended, or your participation in Techstars Services. You will have the ability to opt out of such communications.
To document and promote Techstars and our events
If we create any Event Recordings, we or our event sponsors or participants may use those Event Recordings (including any personal information therein) as part of our marketing and promotional activities. Further, we may also publish the Event Records, including personal information therein, in connection with our documentation of or publicity relating to those Events, for example, on the Techstars website or a relevant Event-specific page. We may seek your consent or a release from you in the event the nature of our processing requires such consent or release. However, in certain circumstances, we may process or publish certain video, images, etc. without your consent, such as when we publish on an Event page certain Event Recordings that include images of groups or crowds in attendance at an Event.
For online advertising
We use may use your personal information we collect from cookies and similar technologies in order to market certain products and services to you, such as Events you may be interested in. For example, if you attend an Event, we may use your personal data in connection with online advertising campaigns on Google, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn. We, or our third party advertising partners, may combine this information in order to create profiles that are used to make more relevant profiles. You can control how these third parties use your data, and the ads you see on these platforms, using the tools described in the Your Rights and Choices section below.

Please note, in certain cases (such as in connection with our Diversity & Inclusion efforts), we may collect and share with parties you authorize, information about race, ethnic origin, religious beliefs, physical/mental health, sexual orientation, or other personal information that is classified as a “special category” of personal data under applicable law. You may revoke your consent to this processing at any time. Additional information regarding these programs, how your personal information will be shared, and the parties that may receive it, are available within program descriptions we provided at the time you agreed to participate in the program.

We may disclose or use aggregated or de-identified information for any purpose, subject to limits under applicable law. For example, we may share aggregated or de-identified information with prospects, partners, or sponsors for business or research purposes, such as when we analyze and report on demographic trends to measure our objective of having healthy diversity ratios across our programs.
If we process personal information in connection with our Services in a way not described in this Privacy Policy, this Privacy Policy will still apply generally (e.g. with respect to your rights and choices) unless otherwise stated when you provide it.
Note that we may, without your consent, also process your personal information on certain public interest grounds.

Please see the Data Sharing section for more information about how we disclose personal information in extraordinary circumstances.
