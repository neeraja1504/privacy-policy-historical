Privacy Policy - The Online Dog Trainer
Doggy Dan here again.
In putting together this blog, I’ve tried to be as transparent as possible while assuming that you are a reasonable person who uses common sense. Alas, common sense is apparently no longer enough in this legal world of ours and my lawyer is insisting the following language be included. So here we go:
This privacy policy describes the collection of information by The Online Dog Trainer Ltd. (“Doggy Dan”, “we”, “us” or “our”) from users of our websites www.doggydan.com and www.theonlinedogtrainer.com (the “Site”), and users of the various services we provide on the Site (collectively, the “Service”), as well as our use and disclosure of that information. By using the Site or any Service, you consent to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
