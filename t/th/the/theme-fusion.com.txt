__  4. Website Analytics (Google Analytics)
This website uses Google Analytics as website analytics service, which is operated by Google Inc. (600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA).
In order to analyze your use of this website, Google Analytics uses cookies. For more information about cookies in general, please see the Cookies section of this Privacy Policy. The information generated by these cookies is usually sent to Google servers in the USA and is also stored there. We, the operator of this website, have a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to be able to optimize both, the user experience when surfing the website and also advertising on it. That means that the usage of Google Analytics cookies is in accordance with on Art. 6 (1) (f) of EU’s GDPR.
This website also uses the demographic features of Google Analytics, which allow obtaining reports about the average age, gender, and interests of the website visitors. The data is constructed from interest-based advertising from Google and third-party visitor data and cannot be attributed to any specific individual person. This feature is not specific to this website and can thus be disabled on your individual Google account, or by opting out of Google Analytics tracking on this site, as explained below.
For more information about how Google Analytics handles user data, see Google’s privacy policy.
Since we value your privacy, we have taken precautious measures regarding the data sent to Google Inc., as can be seen below.
Data processing agreement
We have entered into an agreement with Google Inc. regarding the processing of outsourced data a, which ensures the implementation of the requirements of US, EU and other data protection authorities when using Google Analytics.
IP anonymization
We use Google’s IP anonymization feature on this website. Thus, Analytics anonymizes the address as soon as technically feasible at the earliest possible stage of the collection network. The IP anonymization/masking takes place as soon as data is received by the Analytics Collection Network, before any storage or processing takes place, guaranteeing that the full IP address is never written to disk in this case.
The IP anonymization feature in Analytics sets the last octet of IPv4 user IP addresses and the last 80 bits of IPv6 addresses to zeros in memory shortly after being sent to the Analytics Collection Network.
Google uses the masked IPs to evaluate the use of this website, to create reports about website activity and to provide other statistical data.
Opting out of Google Analytics
Browser Settings
You generally can prevent storage of the Analytics cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. This, however, will mean that you won’t be able to experience the full functionality of this website.
Browser Plugin
Google also offers a browser plugin to conveniently prevent data transmission from the Analytics cookies to the Analytics Collection Network. The plugin can be downloaded here: Google Analytics Opt-out.
