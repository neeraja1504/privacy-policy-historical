GreaterGood Network (owner & operator of The Breast Cancer Site) makes every effort to be in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. The following explains the Act and what GreaterGood Network does to meet its requirements.
About the Act
If you operate a commercial Web site or an online service directed to children under 13 that collects personal information from children or if you operate a general audience Web site and have actual knowledge that you are collecting personal information from children, you must comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and Rule apply to individually identifiable information about a child that is collected online, such as full name, home address, e-mail address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact the child. The Act and Rule also cover other types of information -- for example, hobbies, interests and information collected through cookies or other types of tracking mechanisms â€” when they are tied to individually identifiable information.
How GreaterGood Network Complies with the Act
GreaterGood Network does not collect individually identifiable information about children. Registration and subscription services are for persons aged 13 and older only. We request that no child under 13 register on our site.
If you have questions or concerns about GreaterGood Network's compliance with the Act, please contact us at GreaterGood Network: (206) 859-5201 or e-mail: customerservice@thebreastcancersite.com.
