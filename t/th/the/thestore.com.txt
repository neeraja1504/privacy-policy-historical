As used in this Policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our Affiliates within the United States or internationally.

We may use “cookies” to better facilitate the use of our online and mobile environments. You may remove or block cookies using your browser settings, but this may also negatively impact your ability to use our Platform. For example, you may have difficulty logging in or using certain interactive features of our Site.
TheStore may utilize Non-Personal Information, i.e. data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, for certain general purposes such as to customize content and advertising, improve services, provide generic research and reporting to internal parties.

We collect information when you register to join TheStore by logging into an account that you already have with certain third-party social networking Sites (“SNS”) (including, but not limited to, Facebook and Twitter) via our Site. For example, our Site allows you to create an account and login to the Site using your Facebook account credentials through Facebook Connect. If you are not currently registered as a user on the Site and you click on “Sign in Using Facebook,” you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and join TheStore.

Verify a user’s identity for security purposes.
Create and manage your account.

Your Registration Information is protected by a unique customer password and user ID, and your password is encrypted. You should not disclose your password information to anyone and you should always remember to log off if using a shared computer.

If the user logins to the Site through 3rd party sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and the like, the user is subject to and bound by privacy policies and terms of the 3rd party sites.
