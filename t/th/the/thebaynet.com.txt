TheBayNet Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy Effective as of July 1, 2014 INTRODUCTION Logan Ventures, LLC, doing business as TheBayNet.com ("TheBayNet" or "we") wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications ("apps"), and widgets (collectively, the "TheBayNet"). By using TheBayNet, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. As set forth in our Terms of Use, the TheBayNet are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use the TheBayNet without being registered with or subscribing to a TheBayNet and those who have registered with or subscribed to a TheBayNet Service. This Privacy Policy applies to TheBayNet's collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address). It also describes generally TheBayNet's practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage). COLLECTION OF INFORMATION TheBayNet and our service providers collect the following information from and about you: Registration Information is the information you submit to register, for example, to create an account, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a contest or sweepstakes. Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code and birthday. Public Information and Posts consist of comments or content that you post to the TheBayNet and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture. Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines. Information from Social Media. If you access or log-in to TheBayNet through a social media service or connect a TheBayNet to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service. When you access the TheBayNet through social media services or when you connect a TheBayNet to social media services, you are authorizing TheBayNet to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Activity Information. When you access and interact with the TheBayNet, we may collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the TheBayNet, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the TheBayNet from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geo location data, or other transactional information for that device. At this time we do not respond to browser 'Do Not Track' signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted. Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies) are comprised of small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier. Websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the TheBayNet, such as pages you have visited, content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen. If TheBayNet wishes to combine your personal information with information we obtain through these technologies in order to determine what messages TheBayNet provides to you, we will obtain your express affirmative consent. Third parties that support the TheBayNet by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate TheBayNet usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information. TheBayNet does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information. Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website, see http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy policy/faq.html. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the TheBayNet. Information from Other Sources. We may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information from social media services, commercially available sources and information from our TheBayNet Affiliates or business partners. USE AND DISCLOSURE We use the information we collect from and about you to provide the TheBayNet and features to you, including: to measure and improve those TheBayNet and features; to improve your experience with both online and off-line TheBayNet by delivering content you will find relevant and interesting, including advertising and marketing messages; to allow you to comment on content and to provide you with customer support and to respond to inquiries. When the information collected from or about you does not identify you as a specific person, we may use that information for any purpose or share it with third parties.

TheBayNet may make your information available to certain third party service providers, such as contractors, agents or sponsors, who help us manage or provide the TheBayNet. To allow social sharing functionality. If you log in with or connect a social media service account with TheBayNet, we may share your user name, picture, and likes, as well as your activities and comments with other TheBayNet users and with your friends associated with your social media service.

To deliver relevant advertisements. TheBayNet and our service providers may use the information we collect from and about you to deliver relevant ads to you when you use the TheBayNet or another service.

TheBayNet may share your information with business partners to permit them to send you marketing communications consistent with your choices. To protect the rights of TheBayNet and others.
