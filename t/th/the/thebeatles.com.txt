What is sensitive personal data?
Sensitive personal data (also known as ‘special categories of personal data’) is a more sensitive category of personal information which relates to a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning (mental or physical) health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.
Please do not provide sensitive personal data to us through our website.  With your interests in mind, we do not actively solicit sensitive personal data from users of our website.  Registered users with a beatles.com “My Account” profile should note that if they refer to their hobbies, interests, spare time activities, opinions and beliefs when they talk about themselves on their profile page, this may indicate e.g. their religious beliefs or racial or ethnic origin and this will amount to sensitive personal data.  Users might inadvertently provide this information in “free text” boxes.  You must exercise caution. Please note – you must not volunteer this kind of information about yourself.
The same points apply to criminal convictions and offences data.
