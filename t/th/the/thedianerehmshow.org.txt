Additional Information for WAMU Members/Donors
A principal foundation of public broadcasting is our reliance on support from the people who rely on our programs.  Because we operate in the public interest, our future relies on a bond of public trust.  This bond extends to thousands of listeners living in hundreds of local communities of every size and description throughout WAMU’s region of service.  WAMU 88.5 cannot afford, either in appearance or in fact, to undermine that bond.  For these reasons, WAMU 88.5 certifies that is meets the following public-interest standards:
Control:   WAMU 88.5 will maintain active control of membership and donor lists, and takes reasonable measures to insure against unauthorized use of such lists including requiring any third party (e.g. list brokers, mailing management organizations, fundraising organizations, prospect research/data screening services, online fundraising services, telemarketing agencies, inbound telephone services, and advertising/public relations agencies) to abide by WAMU/American University’s compliance requirements.
Privacy:   WAMU 88.5 will respect the privacy of all subscribers and donors by offering a means by which subscribers and donors may “opt out” by contacting the WAMU Member Services office at membership@wamu.org.  Requests from WAMU members to withhold their names and contact information from solicitation by WAMU-generated letter, telephone, or electronic fundraising efforts are recorded in each individual’s donor file and honored.  Member and donor names and information are used to further the financial support of WAMU 88.5, and infrequently for confidential media research into WAMU listener trends and listening preferences.
Limits On Use:   WAMU policy forbids the renting, selling, leasing, loan, trade, giving, donating, transferring, or exchanging of donor names with any other nonprofit agency.
Per CPB requirements, WAMU 88.5 will not rent, sell, lease, loan, trade, give, donate, transfer, or exchange names to or with any candidate for public office, committees or organizations supporting a candidate, political parties, or organizations that solicit funds for use in political campaigns for any purposes whatsoever.
Record Keeping:   WAMU 88.5 will maintain complete and accurate records of all uses of membership and donor lists for fundraising purposes, and must furnish such records upon request to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  Upon your direct, personal request, we will provide you with the current information (e.g., email address, name, etc.) that we maintain about you through the most secure means available.
If you have any questions about giving or pledging your support to WAMU, or if we can be of any assistance to you, do not hesitate to contact us by e-mail to membership@wamu.org, by telephone Monday through Friday between 9 AM and 5 PM Eastern time (excluding holidays) at (202) 885-1252, or by U.S. mail to:
