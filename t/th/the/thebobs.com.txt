Information that has no direct connection to your actual identity, such as your favorite websites or the number of users on a page, is not considered personal data.

- the date, time and duration of a page view
- the amount of data transferred

The personal data made available by a user will be used exclusively for the purpose of the technical administration of the website and the fulfillment of your wishes and requests. Your personal information will not be distributed, sold or otherwise transmitted to third parties for commercial or advertising purposes.
Use of Cookies
In general, cookies serve the purpose of reminding a site's provider of who your are. Cookies are small bits of data on your computer (a text file with numeric codes) that are sent from a Web server to your browser and saved on your hard drive. You have the possibility to adjust your browser settings to receive an alert when a cookie has been received. That gives you the choice of deciding whether you want to accept the cookie or not.
Our websites generally do not make use of cookies. Only in exceptional cases do we use so-called session cookies. Session cookies only exist for the duration of a visit and only save the data in a Web browser that are necessary to technically facilitate a visit. These data are not personal and are deleted upon closure of the browser.
Security
We strive to meet all the technical and organizational security measures required to protect your personal data from loss or abuse. All personal data is stored in a secure operating environment that is not accessible to the public.
Additional Information
If you have questions concerning the processing of your personal data, you can contact us, including in cases when you are looking for information or have comments or criticism.
Upon submission of a written inquiry, we will inform you which data about you (such as name or address, etc.) has been saved. You have the opportunity to submit a written request for the deletion of any user data pertaining to you that we have saved.
