Privacy
We take very seriously your privacy and the security of your private information. This page describes our procedures in that area with respect to our websites www.theglobaleconomy.com, www.globalpetrolprices.com, and www.globalenergyprices.com. Please feel free to contact us with any questions.
SSL technology
Our websites use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in order to protect the information that you submit. This type of technology protects you from having your information intercepted by anyone other than us while it is being transmitted to us. We work hard to ensure that our sites are secure and that they meet industry standards.
What private information do we collect and why
We ask for user ID’s, e-mail addresses, and passwords when users of our websites open accounts to download data or subscribe to receive our newsletters. All of the information is obtained with explicit consent and is provided by users who actively engage with the websites. Our databases keep that information until the moment when a user unsubscribes from the newsletter or closes her/his account with us.
Information related to payments
We do not see, have access to, collect, or store payments information as all payments on our websites use these third party platforms: Stripe (privacy policy) and Paypal (privacy policy).
Sharing of your personal information with third parties
We do not share your information with third parties except when required by law.
Cookies
Each of our websites has Google Analytics and Google Adsense codes that collect user information through cookies in order to analyze user behavior. Cookies are small files containing information the website uses to track the behavior of visitors. The objective is to allow Google Analytics to collect and provide us with information about the use of our sites in order to improve them, as well as to provide targeted ads through the Google Adsense platforms. You can learn about Google's privacy policies here and more specifically about the Google Analytics privacy policy here.
Also, when you share an article using the social networks buttons (for example, Facebook) on our websites, the social network that created this button will save this action.
Also, we use so-called sessions to store some parameters of your interaction with the websites to improve your experience. For example, if you select to see data in gallons as opposed to litres, this information will be stored while you use the websites so you don’t have to select gallons multiple times.
If you are concerned about the use of cookies, you can easily disable them. All browsers allow you to manage your cookies preferences, including to turn them off completely. That can be done in the “settings” or “options” sections of each browser.
Control over your information
Please contact us by telephone or e-mail if you would like to change or delete your information on our websites. We assure you that you have complete control over your data on our websites and servers.
