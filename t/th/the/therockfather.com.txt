The Rock Father: Privacy Policy
Updated May 25, 2018
PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE RELATED TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEBSITE.
THE ROCK FATHER™  respects the privacy concerns of all users. Protection of personal and sensitive information is paramount. This Privacy Policy discloses what type of information is collected, the method used to collect it and how THE ROCK FATHER utilizes the information to better serve all interested parties. Your use of THE ROCK FATHER website constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy and any other applicable terms. The Terms of Service for this website are hereby incorporated by reference.
For European Visitors -  GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation): The Rock Father Magazine uses Quantcast Choice, a consent management tool for publishers and advertisers built on the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework. When visiting this site, periodically you may be presented with a pop-up message inviting you to opt-in for data sharing.
Quite simply, aside from cookies and limited information that you would voluntarily provide (detailed further below on this page), The Rock Father™ Magazine does not store your personal information and has no interest in doing so. We do not allow user accounts (hence no login needed), currently send no newsletters (we may eventually, which you would opt-in to, should that occur) and only pass-through limited, non-personally-identifiable data to gauge demographics, interests, readership location, etc. That said, many third-parties do collect certain data (advertisers, comment providers like Disqus, contest partners like Rafflecopter, etc.) and each has their own privacy policy and opt-in procedures. When you choose to opt-in via the pop-up box, those will be covered or be able to be excluded thanks to the advanced settings.
