DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY WHEN I LINK TO OTHER WEBSITES?

IS THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT SECURE?
We strive to secure transmission of your Personally Identifiable Information from your computer to our servers through commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures.  To help ensure the integrity and privacy of the Personally Identifiable Information you provide via the Internet at the time you purchase any product or donate online, the above mentioned third party e-commerce partners, Shopify.com and Strategic Fulfillment Services inc, provide Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) digital security.  Only employees who need access to your Personally Identifiable Information to perform a specific task or function are granted access to such Personally Identifiable Information.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no employee of the Foundation will have access to your credit card information provided through this Website.
