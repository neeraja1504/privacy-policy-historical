When Theranos Discloses Information
Theranos does not share your personally-identifiable information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent.
We may disclose some Automatically Collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide website hosting, maintenance, and security services; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist Theranos in improving the Theranos Website and creating new services features. We require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy. We authorize only a limited use of such information for the listed purpose, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures.
Theranos may disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.
Theranos also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; protect Theranos from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Theranos Website; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Theranos, our Users, or others.
Your Choices
If you do not contact Theranos by email, then your use of the Theranos Website will not provide your personally-identifiable information to Theranos.
Data Security
Theranos uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Theranos, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Theranos makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
If Theranos learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Theranos may post a notice on the Theranos Website if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at privacy@theranos.com.
Children’s Privacy
If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not email or contact Theranos at any time or in any manner.
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Theranos does not knowingly collect or maintain personally-identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age. If Theranos learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been provided to Theranos, then Theranos will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has provided personal information to Theranos, then please contact Theranos at info@theranos.com to have that child’s information deleted.

In addition, because Theranos operates globally, we may make information we gather available to worldwide business units and affiliated companies. By providing any data on the Theranos Website, you hereby expressly consent to such transfers of your data to the United States or other countries.
In the Event of Merger or Sale
In the event that Theranos is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from the Theranos Website as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.
