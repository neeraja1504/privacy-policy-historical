Identity Verification
Subject Access Requests (SAR) are passed to the Data Protection Officer as soon as received and a record of the request is made, who will use reasonable measures to verify the identity of the individual making the access request, especially where the request is made electronically.
Where we are unable to verify your details, we may contact you for further information, or ask you to provide evidence of your identity prior to actioning any request. This is to protect your information and rights.
If a third party, relative or representative is requesting the information on your behalf, we will verify their authority to act for you and again, may contact you to confirm their identity and gain your authorisation prior to actioning the any request.
