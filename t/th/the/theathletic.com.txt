Privacy Policy – The Athletic
Effective Date: July 24, 2019
We at The Athletic Media Company (“The Athletic,” “we” and “us”) know you care about how your Personal Data (defined below) is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By using or accessing the theathletic.com or our app (together, the "Services") in any manner, you acknowledge that you understand and you hereby consent to the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, including that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.
If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland (together, the “EEA”), you have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data. Please click here to see our Privacy Policy for EEA residents. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at privacy@theathletic.com.
Remember that your use of The Athletic’s Services is at all times subject to the Terms of Service, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Service.
What does this Privacy Policy cover?
This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information, including “Personal Data” as it is defined in the GDPR (“Personal Data”), that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. For this Privacy Policy, we also use the term “processing” as it is defined in the GDPR, which generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. We will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.
We gather various types of Personal Data from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Data internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our Services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Data with third parties, but only as described below.
We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 (or under the age of 16 in the European Union). If you are under 13 (or 16 where applicable), please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Data about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 13 (or 16 where applicable), we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 (or 16 where applicable) may have provided us Personal Data, please contact us at privacy@theathletic.com.
Will The Athletic ever change this Privacy Policy?
We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to significant changes by placing a notice on the theathletic.com or our app, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or if you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. Please check back regularly for any updates to this Privacy Policy. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.
What Information does The Athletic Collect?
Information You Provide to Us:
We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Data, including without limitation, the following:
First and last name
Username
Email address
Mailing Address
Age and birthday
Preferred teams, leagues and other sports preferences
User content and other information you directly upload to the Services i.e. in comments sections, which can include Personal Data if you include Personal Data in such content
Certain information may be required to register with us, subscribe to some of our Services, or to take advantage of some of our features.
We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our Services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by updating your account settings or clicking 'unsubscribe' in our emails.
Information Collected Automatically
Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which include the following:
IP address
Cookies and other tracking technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixel tags, SDKs, etc.)
Device identifiers
Web browser information
Page view statistics
Usage information
Location information
“ Cookies ” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. For more information, please review our Cookie Policy.
We use third party analytics services in order to better understand user engagement with the Website. When a user browses or uses the Website, these third party analytics services may collect the user’s IP address, browser type, and approximate location (based on the IP address). They may also use web logs or web beacons and may set and access cookies on your computer or other device.
If you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.
We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.
Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy
Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.
Information Collected from Third Parties
We collect Personal Data about you when third parties, such as our business partners or service providers, provide us with Personal Data about you. Such third parties provide us with Personal Data about you, such as the following:
Account information for third party services: If you interact with a third party service when using our Services, such as if you use a third party service to log-in to our Services (e.g., Facebook Connect or Twitter OAuth), or if you share content from our Services through a third party social media service, the third party service will send us information about you, such as information from your public profile, if the third party service and your account settings allow such sharing. The information we receive will depend on the policies and your account settings with the third party service.
Information from our advertising partners: We receive information about you from some of our service providers who assist us with marketing or promotional services related to how you interact with our websites, applications, products, services, advertisements or communications.
Will The Athletic Share Any of the Personal Data it Receives ?
We do not rent or sell your Personal Data in personally identifiable form to anyone. We may share your Personal Data with third parties as described in this section:
Information that’s been de-identified. We may de-identify your Personal Data so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.
Affiliated Businesses: In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us). For example, we may partner with a local sports team to run a promotion for our users. You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Data with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.
Our Agents: We employ other companies and people, such as vendors and third party service providers, who work on our behalf and provide us with services related to the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. These parties include:

Business Transfers: We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer user information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. **** Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Data could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party, and we would share Personal Data with the party that is acquiring our assets. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Data as set forth in this policy.
Protection of The Athletic and Others: We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to:

Is Personal Data about me Secure ?
Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Data by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

We also take measures to ensure subprocessors that process Personal Data on our behalf also have appropriate security controls in place.
We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Data we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. We take various steps to protect your information, including, but not limited to, the following:
We implement technical measures to prevent unauthorized access, and keep security patches and software up-to-date
We restrict employee access to your information on a need-to-know basis
We store sensitive Personal Data in encrypted form
