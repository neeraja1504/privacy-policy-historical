Privacy Policy | Human Solution
We know how important it is to keep your personal information confidential, especially when shopping online. We are committed to protecting your privacy. The Privacy Policy outlined below informs you of what information we collect when you visit and shop at Human Solution, and how we use that information.
Section 1: What do we do with your information?
When you purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and selling process, we collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address, and email address.
When you browse our store, we also automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.
Email marketing
With your permission, we may send you emails about our store, new products, and other updates.
Section 2: Consent
How do you get my consent?
When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery, or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.
If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.
How do I withdraw my consent?
If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by contacting us at info@humansolution.com or mailing us at: SquareGrove LLC, 2139 W Anderson Ln, Austin, TX, 78757, United States.
Section 3: Disclosure
We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.
Section 4: BigCommerce
Our store is hosted on BigCommerce. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you.
Your data is stored through BigCommerce’s data storage, databases, and the general BigCommerce application. They store your data on a secure server behind a firewall.
For more insight, you may also want to read BigCommerce’s Terms of Service here or  Privacy Statement here.
Section 5: Third-Party Services
In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use, and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.
In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.
As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.
Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.
