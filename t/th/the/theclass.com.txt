We may use analytics programs and service providers, which can use first party cookies to report on your interactions with the Site.
We also collect information from you when you interact with the Site in other ways, including but not limited to, registering for the Services.  For example, when you register for Services on the Site you will be voluntarily providing to us, through our vendor MINDBODY Inc., your first and last name, email address and postal or physical address, which is information that enables us to identify you personally (“Personally Identifiable Information”).
Please note that any Personally Identifiable Information or content that you voluntarily disclose in any potentially public areas of our Site becomes publicly available and can be viewed, collected, and/or used by other users of our Site.  You should therefore exercise caution before disclosing your Personally Identifiable Information via these public venues.

We will use the information we obtain about you in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.  We will use information you provide to us, including Non-Personally Identifiable Information or Personally Identifiable Information, in connection with receiving email notifications from us.  We may also use your information, including Non-Personally Identifiable Information or Personally Identifiable Information, to better serve you and enhance your experience with the Site, among other things.  This may include having to modify or copy such Non-Personally Identifiable Information or Personally Identifiable Information, or other information such as images or textual content you provide, in order to provide you with a seamless and enjoyable user experience on our Site or Services.  Toward these ends, you consent to our use and disclosure of any such information submitted to us via the Site or Services, or information collected when you access the Site or Services in any manner.

We may provide or obtain any of the above services through third parties, which may necessitate sharing Non-Personally Identifiable Information or Personally Identifiable Information with them.
We may also use and disclose Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information: to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity, fraud, or activities that threaten the integrity, functionality, or operation of our Site or Services; to protect and defend our rights or property or the rights or property of others; as required in any legal proceedings by courts, administrative agencies, or procedural rules; as required by federal or state laws; and in connection with a financing, sale, merger, or reorganization of our business or assets.  Any successor-in-interest to our business would acquire the information we maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information, and may alter the terms of this Privacy Policy.
We do not and will not sell any of your Personally Identifiable Information to any third party for purposes of marketing, advertising, or soliciting.  We may, however, have to disclose your information, including Non-Personally Identifiable Information or Personally Identifiable Information, to other companies or entities in the event that our business may be sold or is sold to another company or entity.  In that case, your information, including Non-Personally Identifiable Information or Personally Identifiable Information, may be sold or transferred to such acquiring company or entity.
