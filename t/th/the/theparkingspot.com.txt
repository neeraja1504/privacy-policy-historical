1. Types of Information Collected
The Websites and Apps collect both personal information and non-personal or aggregate information from and about you.
“Personal information” is information by which you can be personally identified or contacted, and may include your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number(s), username, and credit/debit card number and related payment information. Personal information also may include information that may not be personally identifiable standing alone (for example, your reservation dates), but which may become personally identifiable when combined with personal information (for example, your reservation dates combined with your name). Many pages and features on our Websites and Apps can be visited and used without providing any personal information. For other pages, functionalities and services, you may be prompted or invited to provide certain personal information.
“Non-personal” or “aggregate” information is data that is about you but which does not identify you as an individual and is not linked to your personal information. This may include information such as your reservation dates, communication and other preferences, goods and services purchased and special requests made, information about your computer, devices and Internet connection when you use the Websites and Apps (such as your device type, browser type, IP address, and mobile identifiers such as Apple IDFA and Android Advertising ID), and certain information about your activities while using our Websites and Apps (such as your referring website, click stream data, the search terms you enter, your movement within and interaction with the Websites and Apps, the pages and features you access or visit on the Websites and Apps, the links and ads that you click, and the length of time you spend using the Websites and Apps). Non-personal information also may include personal information that has been de-identified, or in other words, rendered anonymous. For example, survey information that you volunteer may be anonymized and/or aggregated such that it no longer personally identifies you, and would then be considered non-personal or aggregate information. Non-personal information often is collected through the use of cookies, anonymous identifiers, pixel tags, web beacons, scripts, and other similar technologies. Click  here  to learn more about how these types of technologies are used on the Websites and Apps.
2. How Information is Collected
Information is collected from and about you on the Website and Apps through various means, including directly from you when you provide it (for example, via forms that you fill out on the Websites and Apps, through emails and other communications and information that you submit via the Websites and Apps, and through your other activities on the Websites and Apps), and automatically as you navigate through and interact with the Websites, Apps and their content (including via cookies, anonymous identifiers, pixel tags, beacons, scripts, and other tracking technologies).

This information includes, but is not limited to: (i) information about your computer, devices and Internet connection when you use the Websites and Apps (such as your device type, browser type, IP address, a mobile identifier associated with a mobile device (such as Apple IDFA and Android Ad ID), and the area of the country where you are located (but not your precise geographic location)); (ii) certain information about your activities while using our Websites and Apps (such as your referring website, click stream data, the search terms you use, your movement within and interaction with the Websites and Apps, the pages and features you access, use or visit on the Websites, the links and ads that you click, and the length of time you spend using the Websites and Apps); and (iii) other information collected by cookies, pixels, web beacons, scripts, and other tracking technologies.

3. How We Use Your Information
We may freely use non-personal information or aggregate information for any lawful purpose. We also may use your personal information for various purposes. In general, we use information, including personal information, from and about you:
To develop, deliver, provide and improve our Websites, Apps, services and content;
To accommodate your preferences and to customize your experience with our Websites and Apps;
To support and process the transactions, and provide the services and support, that you have requested;
To register and administer your membership in our loyalty programs;
To verify communications from you, respond to your inquiries and otherwise communicate with you;
For marketing and promotional purposes, including without limitation sending you promotional materials and offers that we believe may be of interest to you, and managing content and advertising;
To enforce our Terms and Conditions and contracts with third parties;
To send you important notices, such as communications about reservations and changes to our terms, conditions and policies (because this information is important to your interaction with The Parking Spot, you may not opt-out of receiving these communications);
To prevent fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities or to otherwise comply with applicable laws and regulations;
To protect the security or integrity of our Websites, Apps, services and our business and to investigate actual and alleged claims against us;

For any other purpose that is permissible or required under the law, that is disclosed to you at the point of collection of personal information, or for which you provide your prior consent.
Payment information (i.e., credit or debit card number, cardholder name, expiration date, EPP code and billing address) is generally obtained only to process a specific transaction. However, members of our loyalty program may choose to link their membership card with a credit card to pre-fill online reservation forms and for convenience of payment. In either case, we only retain debit and credit card information in tokenized form. The Parking Spot may use IP addresses to provide aggregated data to advertisers about the volume of use on the Websites and Apps, to determine your general (but not precise) geographic location, to create and segment audiences and otherwise to target advertising, and to help identify and log potential malicious use of our Websites and Apps.
We reserve the right to combine personal information we collect on the Websites with data collected or received from other sources. If we combine any non-personal information with personal information that is covered by this Privacy Policy, the combined information will be treated as personal information pursuant to this Privacy Policy as long as it remains combined. We may store personal information for as long as needed for the purposes indicated in this Privacy Policy (which may be indefinitely) or for such period as may be permitted or required by law. We may anonymize information that we have collected or otherwise obtained and use that information in connection with interest-based advertising, to create audience segments and/or for other online advertising purposes. Non-personal information (including anonymized information and other non-personal information that is automatically collected as you navigate through and use the Websites and Apps) is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and we can use and share such information without restriction for any lawful purpose, including without limitation for business and marketing purposes.
4. How We Share Information
The Parking Spot may freely share and disclose aggregated and other non-personal information (including anonymized information and other non-personal information that is automatically collected as you navigate through and use the Websites) without restriction as permitted by law. The Parking Spot also may share your personal information with and disclose it to third parties for any lawful purpose, including without limitation to:
Your company or organization if you use the Websites and Apps, register for loyalty programs, or use the Websites or Apps to make parking or car care reservations with us, under a corporate or commercial account;
Our parent, subsidiaries, related companies and controlled affiliates, who may use such information for our or their own business and marketing purposes, as well as for any of the purposes disclosed in or consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy;

Other third parties in order to fulfill the purpose for which you provide it (including without limitation your credit card issuer);
For any other purpose disclosed when you provide the information; and
Others with your consent.
We reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify you and we may use and disclose any information about or relating to you, including any personal information about you, to third parties without your consent if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with a court order, search warrant, subpoena, or other legal process; (2) to comply with legal, regulatory or administrative requirements of any governmental authorities; (3) otherwise fulfill a government or law enforcement request for information; (4) establish, defend or exercise our legal rights; (5) protect or defend the Websites, Apps, users, or our subsidiaries and affiliates, and all of their respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents, contractors, licensors, and partners, in connection with any actual or alleged legal action, claim or dispute; (6) respond to claims that any posting or other content of our Websites or Apps violates the rights of third parties, including without limitation providing information necessary to satisfy the notice and counter-notice procedures pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act; (7) in an emergency, to protect the health and safety of our Websites’ and Apps’ users or the general public; or (8) enforce compliance with our Terms and Conditions or other contractual obligations.
**5. Cookies and Other Technologies **
The Parking Spot, its service providers, marketing partners, and other third parties may use cookies, either alone or in conjunction with anonymous identifiers, pixel tags, web beacons, scripts and other technologies, to obtain certain information about Website and App users. A "cookie" is a small text file that can be placed on your computer or other device when you visit a website or use an app. Cookies help to improve your user experience and allow us to analyze our Websites and Apps and to analyze and manage our advertising. While some cookies are deleted when you close your browser (session cookies), others remain even after you close your browsing session (persistent cookies). Cookies alone cannot be used to disclose your individual identity to us. Following are some of the types of cookies that may be used on the Websites and Apps:
Cookies that are necessary for the Websites and Apps to work and/or that enable you to navigate through and take advantage of our Websites, Apps, and their features;
Cookies to request HTTP header information in order to make our Websites function correctly, to personalize content presented to you, to better understand how our users use the Websites and Apps and how we can better serve your needs;
Cookies to enable features and functionality such as the online reservations process (for example, to remember dates used in reservation searches and to fulfill the reservation), remembering your preferences, allowing members of loyalty programs to sign in without typing their passwords, and personalizing your pages;
Cookies to track customer response to our advertisements and content;
Cookies that determine whether your browser is able to receive HTML email messages so that we can determine the appropriate format for you to receive and read email communications from us;
Analytics cookies to provide data about how users interact with Website and App content and advertising campaigns, such as how many people use our Websites and Apps, which pages and features they visit and use, how long they stay there, how visitors come to our Websites ( e.g. through a link from another website or via a search engine), and also to collect information about how users use our Websites and Apps. Analytics cookies may be used alone or in conjunction with unique identifiers, pixel tags, web beacons, scripts, and other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use the Websites and Apps or interact with our ads on other websites and apps.
o We use Google Analytics to measure and report how users interact with our Websites and/or Apps for the purposes of understanding and optimizing web usage, for business and market research, measuring conversion tracking, and managing, measuring, and optimizing the effectiveness of our content and advertising campaigns. For more information about Google Analytics and how it collects and processes data, please see “How Google Uses Data When You Use Our Partners’ Sites or Apps.” For more information about how Google Analytics uses cookies to measure user interactions on websites, click here. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with your personal information. Google’s ability to use and share information collected about your visits to the Websites is restricted by Google’s Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to the Websites by disabling cookies on your browser. If you do not want your website visit data reported by the Google Analytics JavaScript, you also can install the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. This add-on instructs the Google Analytics JavaScript to prohibit sending website visit information to Google Analytics, but does not prevent information from being sent to the website itself or in other ways to other website analytics services. Click here if you would like to learn more about the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, and click here to install the opt-out browser add-on to opt-out of Google Analytics on the web.
Advertising Cookies to manage, target and serve ads through third-party advertising technology when you visit our Websites and use our Apps and when you visit other websites and use other apps.
o Third parties, including advertising networks and other vendors, also may use anonymous identifiers, cookies, pixel tags, beacons, scripts, and other technologies, to track and collect information, including non-personal demographic information, about you and your interests and activities when you visit our Websites and other websites or view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on various websites or mobile platforms. The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements and content on our Websites and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests. This is known as interest-based advertising. We allow third-party companies and others to collect certain anonymous information when you visit our Websites and use our Apps. These companies may collect and use non-personal information (such as, for example, hashed data, click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. Demographic or other interest data may also be associated with your browsers or devices when you use the Websites and Apps, and such data may also be used online to serve you advertisements targeted based on your presumed interests.
o We use Remarketing with Google Analytics and Google AdWords to show you our ads as you browse other websites around the Internet. The Remarketing service delivers our ads through the Google Display Network, which includes both Google.com pages and the sites of trusted publishers. Click here for more information on the types of advertising cookies that Google uses, and here for more information about how Google uses advertising cookies. Click here to read the Google privacy policy. You can opt out of Google's use of cookies and/or customize Google display network ads by visiting the Ads Settings at https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/. Alternatively, you can opt-out of Remarketing by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/. We also use the DoubleClick cookies and/or pixels in connection with Google’s Remarketing service. To learn more about DoubleClick cookie, click here. If you want to permanently opt out of the DoubleClick cookie, you can install the DoubleClick opt out extension by clicking here. To serve ads in our mobile applications, Google may use anonymous identifiers. These perform similar functions to cookies. To learn more about how to opt out of interest-based advertising for your mobile device, click here.
o We also use information collected through cookies, anonymous identifiers, pixels, web beacons, scripts and other technologies to collect, analyze and segment data from websites and other sources to help us provide more effective advertising. For example, we may use data that is available from public or commercial sources and combine it with other data we have collected or received about a user or the user’s device. We work with third-party advertising service partners and platforms that help us provide more effective advertising by, for example, helping us to deliver ads to people who are most likely to be interested in seeing them, keep track of the number of users who saw a particular ad or visited a particular page on our Websites or Apps, and analyze the effectiveness of our ads. While the companies we work with may change from time to time, click on the following links to learn more about the practices of some of the companies we may work with and the choices they may offer with respect to advertising: Lotame, LiveRamp, Adacado and The Trade Desk.
o Some digital advertising companies also are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance, each of which offer a single location to opt-out of certain ad targeting from member companies. To learn more about interest-based advertising generally as well as your options for opting out, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ or http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. Please keep in mind that even if you opt out of receiving ads tailored to your apparent interests, you will continue to see ads from online advertising networks. However, those networks will not be able to apply any of your apparent ad preferences and the ads that you see therefore may be less relevant to your interests.
* Social media cookies may be placed by social media platforms (such as Facebook, Twitter, etc.) for authentication purposes and/or to collect certain information about your visits to and use of our Websites and Apps through social media widgets. Such third-party social media sites are responsible for those cookies and how they process the data they collect and their practices are governed by their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the applicable third-party social media site before using their widgets or functionalities.
Most web browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your web browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. The “Help” feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. For more information on how to manage browser cookies, see http://www.allaboutcookies.org. You also can check your mobile device’s built-in settings to find out how to turn off cookies on your mobile device. Some mobile devices also might store cookies in areas that are app-specific, which cannot be controlled by browser settings. Check your app settings options on your mobile device to find out how to manage or delete cookies that may be stores in these other areas. Please keep in mind, however, that you may not be able to access the full functionality of our Websites and Apps if cookies are disabled. Please also note that disabling or clearing cookies also may affect cookie-based opt-outs by either preventing you from using such cookie-based opt-outs or clearing opt-outs that you previously set, in which case you would have to revisit the applicable pages and renew your opt-out after clearing cookies.
The Parking Spot, its service providers and other third parties also may use web beacons and pixel tags, which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a web page. These technologies may be used, for example, to allow The Parking Spot and its service providers to send emails to you in a format you can read and to count users who have visited our Websites or used our Apps, seen our ads, opened our emails or clicked on any links in our emails. These technologies also may be used by The Parking Spot and its service providers to better target and personalize ads and to track ad campaigns. For example, pixel tags, web beacons and other technologies may allow third-party ad networks to recognize a unique cookie on your web browser or mobile device. This enables us to learn which ads bring users to our Websites and Apps. The information collected may tell the third-party ad network what other websites you have visited that are associated with the network. This information may be used for the purpose of managing, targeting and personalizing ads on our Websites and Apps and other websites and apps based on those interests.
We, our service providers and other third parties may analyze the information derived from cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, scripts and other technologies and match or combine that information with data provided by you or collected or received from public and commercial sources. Please note that to the extent that third parties are using pixel tags, cookies, beacons, scripts or other tracking technologies on our Websites and Apps, The Parking Spot does not control the use of those technologies or the resulting information, the use of which are governed by the privacy policies of those third parties.
6. Online Tracking / “Do Not Track” Signals
Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a “Do Not Track” setting that sends a special signal to the websites you encounter while web browsing that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, and The Parking Spot does not respond to web browser “Do Not Track” signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy to describe how we respond to such signals. We may work with third parties that use tracking technologies on the Websites and Apps, including in order to serve tailored advertisements on our behalf and on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet. These and other third parties may collect information about your activity on the Websites and Apps and other websites and apps over time, as well as your interaction with our advertising and other communications, and use this information to determine which ads you see on third-party websites and applications based on your apparent interests, which is known as interest-based advertising. For more information about this practice and to understand your options, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/ or http://www.aboutads.info. To learn more about Do Not Track, visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com/. Click here to go to the “Cookies and Other Technologies” to read more about interest-based advertising and other online advertising.

Monroe St., Suite 1500, Chicago, IL, 60606,Attention: Legal Department.
8. External Links and Third-Party Ads
The Websites and Apps may contain links to or ads for third-party websites, apps and content that we do not control or maintain. By clicking on those links or ads, you are visiting sites and content that are outside of our control. Be aware that those websites collect information and operate according to their own privacy practices and policies. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites or ads and we are not responsible for the content found on or the actions or privacy practices employed by any other website or app. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of other websites and apps to understand how they collect, use and disclose personal information before submitting any such information to those websites or apps. If you have any questions about the privacy practices of other websites or apps, you should contact the relevant parties controlling these websites apps for more information.
9. Widgets and Social Media Features
The Websites and Apps may include social media features such as the Facebook “Like” button, widgets such as a “Share This” button, or interactive mini-programs that run on our Websites or Apps to provide specific services from another company. These third-party features may collect information about you, like your IP address and the page(s) you visit on the Websites or Apps, as well as personal information, such as your email address. They also may place cookies or other tracking mechanisms on your computer or device to, for example, enable the widget to function properly. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policies of the third-party social media platforms that provide them. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the applicable third-party social media sites before using their widgets and other functionalities.
**10. Location Data **
Our mobile Website and theParkingSpot™ App allow you to use the “Find a Location” feature to find one of our facilities. To use this feature you must enable location services on your mobile device. If you choose to use this feature you will be asked if you want to use location services. If you agree, the Google Maps API will be used to display a zoomed in area on a map “pinning” your geolocation as well as the location of The Parking Spot’s facilities. You also can select one of our facilities from a drop down menu and, if you have enabled location services on your device and agree that you want to use those services, you also can use Google Maps to provide you turn-by-turn driving directions to The Parking Spot facility you have selected. Both the map and driving directions features are provided by Google Maps and it is your choice whether to use these features. We do not control Google Maps, and your use of that functionality is subject to Google’s Privacy Policy, as amended by Google from time to time, which can be reviewed here. Most mobile devices provide users the ability to disable location services, and you will need to enable location services for Google Maps if you wish to use that functionality on the mobile website or mobile application. Most likely, these controls are located in your device's settings menu.
Our TPS Shuttle App allows you to track the location of our parking shuttles at the airports we serve. To use this feature you must enable location services on your mobile device. If you choose to use this feature you will be asked if you want to use location services. If you agree, your geolocation (i.e., your latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates) will be sent from your device, allowing us to determine at which airport you are located. You are then prompted to select which of our facilities serving that airport you are using. We will use your geolocation information to show you a map of the real-time location of our parking shuttles serving the facility you are using and to locate you on our dispatch map so that we can see where and for how long you have been waiting for one of our shuttles. We do not associate your geolocation data with any personal information or share it with third parties other than to fulfill the purpose for which you provide your geolocation information.
11. Protection of Personal Information
We take reasonable steps to protect against the unauthorized access, disclosure, misuse, alteration and destruction of the personal information under our control. For example, our servers are protected by reasonable physical and electronic security measures. We also encrypt data when you make a reservation through the Websites and certain Apps. Since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, the storage and communication of personal information can never be completely secure, including without limitation with respect to computer viruses, malicious software and hacker attacks. We therefore cannot and do not guarantee or warrant that information that you transmit to us, or any communications conducted on or through the Websites or Apps, is or will be totally secure. We are not responsible for the acts of those who gain unauthorized access, and we make no warranty, express, implied or otherwise, that we will prevent such access. For your own privacy protection, we urge you to keep all passwords (including passwords that you may need to access certain portions of the Websites and Apps) confidential. We also recommend that you do not include any confidential or sensitive personal information in any emails that you send to us. If you become aware of any breach of the terms of this Privacy Policy or of the security of the Websites or Apps, please notify us.
12. Notice to California Customers - Your California Privacy Rights
