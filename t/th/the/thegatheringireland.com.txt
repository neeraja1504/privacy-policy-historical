Clicking on a link in any of these emails  may cause you to be personally identified on our site and may cause some part of your past browsing history on our site to be available to our personnel so we may more effectively engage with you and improve our site. If you do not wish for this tracking to occur, you can unsubscribe from our mailings or use private browsing mode to avoid tracking.

7.  Security - How we protect your personal information
The Fáilte Ireland services are designed to provide reasonable and appropriate organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect personal information within our organization against unauthorized or unlawful access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Users of Fáilte Ireland services must also do their part in protecting the data, systems, networks, and service they are utilizing. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that your password to any Fáilte Ireland account has been compromised), please immediately notify us by contacting us in accordance with the “Contact Us” section below.
For your protection, we will only implement requests with respect to personal information about you (not anyone else), and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable and in accordance with applicable law. We may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, as required under applicable legal obligations, and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion (e.g. when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the personal information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion). Some of your information may remain within our systems and other records, in compliance with applicable law.
8. How long do we keep your data for?
To meet our legal and regulatory obligations, any information that you provide to us will be kept and stored for such period of time as we deem necessary taking into account the purpose for which it was collected in the first instance, and our obligations under data protection legislation.
In general, your personal data will be retained by us for two years and six months from the last date of contact or transaction.

We will respond to any rights that you exercise within a month of receiving your request, unless the request is particularly complex or cumbersome, in which case we will respond within three months (we will inform you within the first month if it will take longer than one month for us to respond).
Where a response is required from us within a particular time period pursuant to data protection legislation, we will respond within that time period.
Right to access to personal data relating to you
You may ask to see what personal data we hold about you and be provided with:
a summary of such personal data and the categories of personal data held.
details of the purpose for which it is being or is to be processed.
details of the recipients or classes of recipients to whom it is or may be disclosed, including if they are overseas and what protections are used for those oversea transfers.

details of your rights, including the rights to rectification, erasure, restriction or objection to the processing.

If, to comply with your request, we would have to disclose information relating to or identifying another person, we may need to obtain the consent of that person, if possible. If we cannot obtain consent, we may need to withhold that information or edit the data to remove the identity of that person, if possible.
There are certain types of data which we are not obliged to disclose to you, which include personal data which records our intentions in relation to any negotiations with you where disclosure would be likely to prejudice those negotiations.
We are entitled to refuse a data access request from you where (i) such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of its repetitive character (in this case, if we decide to provide you with the personal data requested, we may charge you a reasonable fee to account for administrative costs of doing so), or (ii) we are entitled to do so pursuant to data protection legislation.
Right to update your personal data or correct any mistakes in your personal data

We will provide you with information on action taken on a request to stop direct marketing – this may be in the form of a response email confirming that you have ‘unsubscribed’.
Rights in relation to automated decision taking (if applicable)
You may ask us to ensure that, if we are evaluating you, we don’t base any decisions solely on an automated process and have any decision reviewed by a member of staff.
Profiling may occur in relation to your personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising and de-targeting you from specified advertising. This allows us to tailor our advertising to the appropriate customers and helps to minimise the risk of you receiving unwanted advertising.
These rights will not apply in all circumstances, for example, where the decision is (i) authorised or required by law, (ii) necessary for the performance of a contract between you and us, or (iii) is based on your explicit consent. In all cases, we will endeavour that steps have been taken to safeguard your interests.
Right to restrict or prevent processing of personal data
In accordance with data processing legislation, you may request that we stop processing your personal data temporarily if:
you do not think that your data is accurate (but we will start processing again once we have checked and confirmed that it is accurate).
the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase your data.
we no longer need the personal data for our processing, but you need the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
you have objected to processing because you believe that your interests should override the basis upon which we process your personal data.
If you exercise your right to restrict us from processing your personal data, we will continue to process the data if:
you consent to such processing.
the processing is necessary for the exercise or defence of legal claims.
the processing is necessary for the protection of the rights of other individuals or legal persons.
the processing is necessary for public interest reasons.

This right only applies to personal data that you have provided to us – it does not extend to data generated by us.
The right to data portability also only applies where:
the processing is based on your consent or for the performance of a contract
the processing is carried out by automated means
Right to erasure

you do not believe that we need your personal data in order to process it for the purposes set out in this policy.

We would only do so in circumstances where such disclosure is permitted under applicable laws, including data protection legislation.
