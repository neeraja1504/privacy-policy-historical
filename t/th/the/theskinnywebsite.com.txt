SSW does not currently collect any personal information regarding users of the site. You should note, however, that any information disclosed in public areas of the Website (such as chat rooms or comments on postings) is public information that may be viewed and collected by any party. Since we cannot control the use of information you post on public areas of the Website, you should not disclose any personally identifiable information in these public areas. For example, do not use your real name or e-mail address on any public area of the Website. If you make a posting, we suggest you use a fictitious name, or use only first name or initials. SSW reserves the right to remove any information at any time from our site that we deem inappropriate or for any other reason.

How do we protect your information?
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information.
Do we use cookies?
Yes. The Website uses a technology called “cookies” which may be used to provide you with tailored information. A cookie is a tiny element of data (a text file) that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so SSW can recognize you when you return. All pages on the Website where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies. These cookies (a) will let SSW know who you are. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, however please note that by not accepting cookies from SSW, you will limit the functionality it can provide when you visit the Website.
Do we disclose any information to outside parties?
SSW is committed to protecting your privacy. We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
Occasionally, SSW hires other companies to provide limited services on its behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service they are engaged to provide. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.
SSW may share aggregated and anonymous demographic information with our business partners but no such information can be linked directly to any personal information about you.
Although SSW will use every reasonable effort to preserve your privacy, it may need to access and disclose certain information, including personally identifiable information, when required by federal, state local or other governmental regulations or laws. Further, SSW may access and/or disclose information we maintain about users if it believes such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on SSW; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of SSW (including the enforcement of its agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of SSW services or members of the public. In such cases, SSW will use reasonable efforts to disclose only such information as is required under the circumstances.
Third party links
Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.
SSW may also allow third-party advertisement serving companies, including advertising networks, to display advertisements on the Website. Advertisement serving companies often place a persistent cookie on your computer in order to recognize your computer each time they display an online advertisement to you. Because these companies may serve advertisements on many different web sites, they may be able to compile information over time about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they display. These companies may use this information to make predictions about your characteristics or preferences and to display targeted advertisements that they believe may be of interest to you. They may also associate this information with your subsequent visit, purchase or other activity on participating advertisers’ web sites in order to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.
These companies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting based on their cookies. You may find more information by clicking on the company name on the Website and following the links to the web sites of each company.
Change in Ownership and Other Business Transaction
In the event SSW goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets (a “Business Transition”), information about our users will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. In such event, SSW’s custody of such information will be transferred subject to all the terms and restrictions in the then current Privacy Policy.
California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance
Because we value your privacy we have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

Security
Unfortunately no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While SSW strives to protect Your Information, it cannot warrant the security of the information you provide online. However, once SSW receives your information, it will do its best to ensure that its systems are functioning properly and will use reasonable and customary efforts to protect that information.
