ArtStack - art online
You (and your love of art!) are at the centre of everything we do. We want to maintain your trust by handling your personal information with respect and putting you in control. We want you to know what personal information ArtStack Limited (known here as "we" or “ArtStack") collects about you, and how we use it.
We seek to make our explanations short and easy to understand. But, if you’d like further information, or have any questions, please contact our Data Protection Officer using the details in the ‘Contact’ section below.
If we ever make any major changes to our privacy practices, we’ll let you know. If necessary, we’ll also ask for your permission.
Privacy Notice
Our Privacy Notice has been designed with our users as our first priority. How the notice applies to you will depend on the way in which you interact with us. For example, if you:
1) set-up or use an account with us, we use the information you provide us to deliver our service (a social discovery platform for art), and, where permitted, keep you up to date about art you might find interesting on the site and users who follow you, or who might seek to purchase your work (for ArtStack Pro users); and
2) when you browse our site, we use cookies to tailor your experience and hopefully provide you with a seamless experience.
Your choices and rights under each scenario are explained in more detail below.
What Information We Have & Where We Get It ** We collect and store different types of information about you when you create an account, buy the ArtStack Pro service, contact us, and use our websites or app.**
When you create an account, buy ArtStack Pro or are invited to the service by a friend, we will collect your information - which may include your contact and billing information. When you sign-up with Facebook or use social media sharing features within ArtStack, we may receive some additional information about you, which is explained in that process (for Facebook, we limit this to a minimal amount of information, i.e. location and gender).
We also keep track of the frequency of your visits, what artworks you’ve added, ‘stacked’, or commented on, what artists or other tags you follow, the number of followers you have and those that you follow, and any invites that you’ve sent.
When you use our websites or apps, we collect information such as the browser and device you're using, your IP address, your location, the site you came from, what you did and didn't use our site/app for, or the site you visit when you leave us.
**How We Use Your Information & Why **
We collect and use your information for lots of reasons such as helping you see art by artists you like, sharing news, for marketing and as otherwise required by law.
1) For the performance of our contract with you
We use your information when you enter into a contract with us (for example to buy the ArtStack Pro service) so we can:
process your order

For our marketing purposes, unless your consent is required for such marketing (see section 3 below).
To send you customer service emails.
To prevent or detect unlawful behaviour, to protect or enforce our legal rights or as otherwise permitted by law. As such, we may use your information to prevent misuse of our intellectual property (e.g. our website), fraud, or other crimes.
To create a profile about you to offer our service, which is by nature personalised. For example, if you like a particular artist, we may email you regarding new artworks by that artist that have been added to ArtStack, or about an exhibition of the artist’s work that is in your city. We make sure our messages and website are relevant to you based on your profile.

Our third-party service providers (sometimes known as data processors) such as cloud computing providers who provide the IT infrastructure on which our products and systems are built.
If you seek to buy or sell art via our platform, we may disclose your information to the buyer or seller (as applicable) to negotiate and complete the transaction.
Government agencies or other authorised bodies where permitted or required by law.
