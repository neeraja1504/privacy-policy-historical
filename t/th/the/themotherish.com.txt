Privacy Policy - Mamamia
1. Your Privacy
Mamamia.com.au Pty Limited (ACN 105 572 192) (“Mamamia”, “we”, “us”, “our”) recognises that your privacy is very important to you and believes that information received by us that can be used to identify an individual user (“you”, “your”, “User”) should be treated with respect. We are serious about adhering to the Australian Privacy Principals and other applicable privacy legislation.
Before providing us with any information, you should read through this policy so that you understand and are comfortable with exactly how we will collect and what we will do with any information you share with Us. This Privacy Policy will also tell you how to access your information and/or seek correction of your information if desired.
By using the Mamamia Sites and/or Services covered by this Policy and providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your account information and usage.
Please refer to the “Enforcement” Section (Section 11) at the end of this Privacy Policy for our contact details should you wish to contact us about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices.
2. What We Collect
Personal and Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We collect “Personal Information”, as well as non-personally identifiable information on Mamamia Sites and/or Services.
“Personal Information,” as used in this Policy, is personally identifiable information, such as your first and last name, mailing address, email address, billing information, IP addresses, demographics, passwords, telephone numbers and/or other online contact information.
Sensitive Information
Mamamia does not collect sensitive information from users for marketing purposes. “Sensitive Information” includes information about a person’s racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, health or genetic information, sexual preference or information about whether an individual is a member of a professional or trade association or union.
Sensitive information might be collected during the course of surveys or competitions administered by Mamamia or its affiliated third parties, but only if volunteered by Users with their consent.
You can choose not to actively volunteer information to Mamamia. However if you do provide information to Mamamia when asked or prompted, including Sensitive Information, you are also providing consent for Mamamia to collect, store and use that information as necessary for the purpose of collecting it.
3. How We Collect Information
We collect information in three ways.
(1) Voluntarily
(2) Automatically
(3) Via Third Party Sources
Voluntarily
We collect information you provide to us in optional, voluntary submissions, including but not limited to registration forms, subscription pages, user profiles, promotional signups, sweepstakes/contest entries, email or phone requests for customer service, software and mobile application downloads and curriculum vitae submissions.
Automatically
Like virtually all other sites, we will create and record information automatically when you visit our Site. We use cookies (or files sent directly to your computer or device) and other similar technology to collect information such as your IP address, the site you visited immediately prior to our Site and the frequency and duration of your visit to our Site.
We may track activity relating to your interaction with our email communications and with links contained within our email communications and our Site. This information is generally non-personally identifiable.
We may also collect, use, and share, with Mamamia partners, service providers and licensees, precise location data, including the real-time location of your mobile or fixed location device.
Some cookies may be associated with Personal Information about you and some may not. This information is generally collected, used and stored to deliver relevant messaging and enhance your experience when visiting our Site.
Via Third Party Sources
We may also obtain information, including Personal Information, from third party sources. This may include soliciting third parties to collect Personal Information on our behalf. In such cases we instruct those third parties to comply with this Policy.
We may use analytics tools and other third party technologies, to collect non-personally identifiable information in the form of various usage and user metrics when you use our Sites and/or Services. These third party analytics companies may combine the information collected for us with other information they have independently collected across their network of websites, products and services. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.
Our properties may feature Nielsen proprietary measurement software, which will allow you to contribute to market research, like Digital Content Ratings. To learn more about the information that Nielsen software may collect and your choices with regard to it, please see the Nielsen Digital Measurement Privacy Policy at http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy.
4. Security and Integrity
We take reasonable measures, including the implementation and maintenance of physical, electronic, and managerial procedures, in an effort to assure the security, integrity, and accuracy of all Personal Information that we collect. If we learn of a security systems breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
We will destroy or de-identify your information if we no longer require the information to provide you with access to our Site/s or Services and if the information is not required to be saved under Australian law or other Commonwealth record.
5. Storage
We store your information on networks in Australia and the US and take reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information from misuse, loss or unauthorized access. These reasonable steps include password access, firewalls, and encryption of credit card details and secure servers.
6. How We Use Information
Generally, we use Personal Information to establish and enhance our relationship with our Users through four main categories:
(1) Communication
(2) Optimization
(3) Marketing & Advertising; and
(4) Sharing Features.
Below, we provide some specific examples of how we use the information we collect.
Communication and Responding to Requests
To provide you with customer support, share communications such as newsletters, process transactions, respond to users’ requests, send newsletters and updates, send special offers and advertisements, seek your opinions and feedback, and connect users to Mamamia Sites and/or Services and to products and services of our partners and licensees.
Optimisation
To provide, improve, and maintain our Sites and Services, to develop new products and services, to prevent abuse and fraud, to personalise and display advertisements and other content for you, and for other administrative and internal business purposes.
Marketing & Advertising
To personalise and display advertisements and other content for you.
We may share your anonymised email address with one or more of our third party business partners, so that you will receive more relevant online ads from us and other parties. This works by dropping a cookie on your browser linked to data that is known about you so that third party advertisers can show you more relevant ads.
We may also use various measurement services and companies to analyse collected data about your engagement with our Sites and Services. The information that is collected is not personally identifiable, and is pseudonymous or aggregated data that does not identify any individual user.
The third party analytics companies that we use may share the User information they collect from our Sites with other measurement companies, who gather data from various sources, analyse and report on it for their clients. The reported information will cover various elements, for example it may summarise how many people have viewed a certain webpage within a certain age bracket.
By using our Sites and Services, you consent to the collection of data by Mamamia’s ad servers or third party affiliates, or the transfer of information to them, wherever necessary for the Network’s performance optimisation. (See Point 8, Marketing and Advertising for Opt Out Options)
Sharing Features
To provide you with various ways to connect and share content with third parties.
By using any third party service to share links to our content, you permit us to access, use and disclose information relating to your account on each such third party service (such as your user name and profile information) if available to us through the third party service.
7. When We Disclose Personal Information
Mamamia will not sell, license or otherwise disclose your Personal Information to third parties unless such disclosure is for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

In order to ensure that our various Sites and Services work together optimally, as described above, we share information (including your information) between our multiple online networks.
Service Providers
We may provide Personal Information to our third party service providers for their use in performing internal business functions or collecting information on our behalf.
Whenever possible, we require such third-parties to only collect and use Personal Information in accordance with this Policy, and for no purpose other than providing us with our requested services.

When you visit or use a part of any Site or Product that is co-branded or that is a part of a joint promotion involving Mamamia and one or more third parties (each a “Co-Branded Party”), you are providing and consenting to provide your collected information to Mamamia and each of the Co-Branded Parties.
