Privacy Policy - Sapphire Leadership Group, Inc.
It is simple. We do not use your information for anything other than what you gave it for.
There are three different batches of information about you that we have:
There is a customer list in the store
There is the newsletter list
There are the personal e-mails you send us
In each case, you gave us the information for that purpose and that is the only purpose we will use it for.
We do not sell or rent your information to others.
And we do not use your information from any one of those sources for other purposes inside our company.
Now this is a joy for many and a source of frustration to others of you. Many people write and want us to connect them with other people in their area. We simply do not do that. At all. Ever.
We will not give your information to others for any reason.
