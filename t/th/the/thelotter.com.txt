2.1.

Your participation in any services is optional and you at all times have the choice of choosing whether to provide any related Personal Information.
2.3.
Transfers of Payments to You. You may be entitled to have us transfer certain amounts of money to you (for example, in connection with lottery winnings). To the extent that we do so, you will first be required to provide us certain Personal Information regarding your preferred payment method. Such information could include your bank account or credit card name and number.
2.4.

If you choose to so purchase a product or services from us we will require sufficient information from you to complete the transaction. Such information could include a credit card number and related account and billing information, invoice related information, and other data required to process the order. We may also update such data should you grant us permission to bill you or your credit card for recurring charges, such as monthly or other types of periodic payments. We may use the tools, software or services of third party service providers to process transactions on our behalf, in which case you acknowledge and agree to review and be bound by the terms of use and privacy policy of said third-party service provider.

Such information may include a copy of your passport, driver's license, national identity card, a utility bill (for proof of address), and/or a copy of the front and back of your credit card that you are using in connection with your Account (we request that you cover and do not send us the credit card code verification (CVV) number; if we receive your CVV number we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete and not store it and may ask that you resubmit a copy of your credit card without the CVV number being visible).

At all times, you may choose whether or not to provide or disclose Personal Information. The notices that we provide on the Site in circumstances where we collect Personal Information should help you to make this choice.

Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites.

We may use a reputable third party to present or serve advertisements that you may see on the Site. These third party ad servers may use cookies, web beacons, clear gifs or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness. The use of these technologies by these third party ad servers is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our Privacy Policy.
Links to Other Sites.
9.1.
The Site may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by theLotter. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of third party websites, and you visit them at your own risk.
Children's Privacy.
10.1.
The Site is not structured to attract individuals under the age of 18. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 18 years.
Security.
11.1.
The security of Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards, including the use of appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, to protect the Personal Information that we collect from you. To the extent that we collect sensitive Personal Information from you (for example, your credit card number or other financial Personal Information), we use SSL encryption to protect that information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on the Site, you can contact us.
In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy.
12.1.
In the event that theLotter is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign Personal Information that we have collected as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how Personal Information is treated, transferred, or used. In any of the circumstances described in this paragraph, the information will be subject to the privacy policy of the purchaser or assignee.
Your California Privacy Rights.
