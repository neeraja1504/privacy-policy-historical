Sponsored Posts & Affiliate Programs Disclosure
In order for me to support my blogging activities, I may receive monetary compensation or other types of remuneration for my endorsement, recommendation, testimonial and/or link to any products or services from this blog.
For your convenience, this website may provide hyperlinks to websites and servers maintained by third parties. Thehealthymaven.com does not control, evaluate, endorse or guarantee content found in such sites.

Here’s what that all means for you:
I occasionally post affiliate links. These links may be for various products that I personally use, ebook bundles, and other similar products from bloggers or Amazon.
Know that anything I endorse on this blog, even if it is paired with an affiliate link, I am endorsing because I truly think the product is great, it is one that I use, and I want to pass on the information to you, my readers. I’ll never endorse products that I don’t personally use. I am not paid to write one way or another, and I choose which products I endorse, no one chooses that for me. Buying products through these links allows for me to maintain and grow The Healthy Maven, and I greatly appreciate your support.
Sometimes some pretty great companies reach out to work together and either compensate me for my time or provide me with free material. I will  _never  _endorse a product that I don’t fully stand behind or think would benefit the audience of The Healthy Maven, and I will always share with you when a post is sponsored. All opinions are 100% my own.
The Healthy Maven is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to  Amazon.com and affiliated sites.
