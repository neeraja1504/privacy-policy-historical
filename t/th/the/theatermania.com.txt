3. California Privacy Rights
Under California law, California residents who have provided personally identifiable information to a company may have the right to request a list of all third parties to whom that company had disclosed such information for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year, along with a list of the categories of Personal Information that had been so disclosed. However, TheaterMania’s policy, as disclosed on this Website, does not currently permit TheaterMania to share the Personal Information collected at this Website about you with non-affiliated third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Moreover, even if TheaterMania’s policy permitted the disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes, because TheaterMania provides you with an opportunity to opt out of such disclosure, TheaterMania does not have to provide you with such lists. If you are a California resident who would like information on how to exercise your rights concerning third party disclosures, you may send an email to or contact us via postal mail at:

We may also share your personal information with the following parties:

8. International Transfers
The personal information we receive may be transferred to, and stored, at locations outside of the EEA for the purposes of processing by us and by third party service providers that work for TheaterMania. This includes North America (USA and Canada).
Where personal information is transferred to and stored in a country not determined by the European Commission as providing adequate levels of protection for personal information, we take steps to provide appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information, including:
entering into standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, obliging recipients to protect your personal information as permitted under Article 46(2)(c) GDPR;
under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (where we transfer personal information to the U.S.), which enables U.S. businesses to self-certify as a means of complying with EU data protection laws.
In the absence of an adequacy decision or of appropriate safeguards as referenced above, we will only transfer personal data to a location outside of the EEA where one of the following applies (as permitted under Article 49 GDPR)):
the transfer is necessary for the performance of our contractual engagement with you;
the transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or
you have provided explicit consent to the transfer.
If you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal information out of the EEA, please contact us using the details set out above.
This Website is controlled and operated by TheaterMania from its offices in the state of New York, United States of America. TheaterMania makes no representation that this Website, or the materials contained hereon, are appropriate for users located in other countries. Those who choose to access this Website from other countries do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with all laws in that country, if and to the extent that such laws are applicable.
9. Security of your personal information
Your debit and credit card information
If you use your credit or debit card to purchase from us or to make a donation, we will ensure that this is carried out securely and in accordance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). You can find more information about this by clicking here.
(https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/).
For TheaterMania Theater Club memberships our payment service provider will store your card details safely for use in future transactions. This is carried out in compliance with PCI-DSS and in a way where none of our staff members can see your full card number. We never store your 3 or 4-digit security code.
Security of your personal information
We have put in place appropriate safeguards (both in terms of our procedures and the technology we use) to keep your personal information as secure as possible. We will ensure that any third parties we use for processing your personal information do the same and that they will only process your personal information on our instructions. The third parties will also be subject to a duty of confidentiality.
TheaterMania staff are not allowed to put personal data on memory sticks or other such storage devices to protect against accidental loss.
Any TheaterMania staff member that has access to personal data on their mobile phones must ensure that their phone is password protected and that in the event of loss, that data can be deleted remotely.
All TheaterMania laptops are encrypted so that personal data cannot be accessed by third parties in the event of theft or loss.
TheaterMania has a full “Leavers Policy” in place to ensure that once an employee leaves the company, they no longer have access to personal data via any means including electronic.
10. Data retention
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
Financial Data will not be retained after your transaction has been completed.
11. Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal information, as follows:
Request access to your personal information
You have a right to request a copy of the personal information that we hold about you. We may refuse to comply with a subject access request if the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive or repetitive in nature.
Request correction of your personal information
You have the right to request that we correct the personal information we hold about you, although we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us. We may refuse to comply with a request for rectification if the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive or repetitive in nature.
Request erasure of your personal information
You have the right to request that we delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. Please note that we may not always be able to comply with your request for erasure if there are specific legal reasons. For example, where the processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
Request restriction of processing your personal information
You have the right to request that we suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. We may refuse to comply with a request for restriction if the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive or repetitive in nature.
Request transfer of your personal information
You have the right to request that the personal information we hold about you is transferred to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Please note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Object to processing of your personal information
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Please contact privacy@theatermania.com to exercise any of the rights listed above.
Please also note the following:
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Time limit to respond
We try to respond to all legitimate requests without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
12. Cookies
This Website makes use of “cookies” - small data files which we may send to your computer on the basis of the information that we have collected about your visit. They contain information allowing us to recognize when you are visiting this Website and to keep track of your preferences. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on our site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our site. Cookies are stored in your computer’s browser or on your hard disk and can then be retrieved by this Website.
This Website uses two kinds of cookies:
so-called “session” cookies, which are deleted from your computer when you leave this Website and are used purely to help you to navigate around this Website; and
“persistent” cookies, which remain on your computer so that this Website can recognize you when you return.
We also use third-party advertising companies to target and show you advertisements when you visit this Website. These third-party advertisers may send “cookies” to your computer or other device to gather information about your preferences to provide you with advertising that is more likely to relate to your interests.
TheaterMania uses two third-party advertising services. We use Google’s DoubleClick to display ads on the TheaterMania.com website, and Centro to serve ads on websites outside of TheaterMania.com. For example, if someone visits a particular show page on TheaterMania.com, we may display an ad for that show on a subsequently visited external website.
Consumers have the ability to stop being personally tracked by either service. Bear in mind when opting out of tracking, one may still see ads based on factors such as the general location derived from your IP address, your browser type, and the page on TheaterMania.com where the ad is served from.
To opt-out of tracking from Google’s advertising services, go to: https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/
