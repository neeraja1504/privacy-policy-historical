Information Collected Through Technology
In addition to any personal information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the TheMovieNation Applications ("Usage Information"). This may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to the TheMovieNation Applications, all of the areas within the TheMovieNation Applications that you visit, and the time of day, among other information. We may use the this Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the TheMovieNation Applications. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for your computer or other device used to access the TheMovieNation Applications (any, a "Device"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the device used to access the TheMovieNation Applications, and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier. Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your personal information, we will treat it as personal information.
A few of the tracking technologies that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following:
Cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site. We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the Site. Cookies are stored on users' hard drives. We use both "session ID cookies" and "persistent cookies." Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Site and expire when the user closes his/her browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Site easier for returning users by remembering a user's login information. Persistent cookies stay on a user's hard drive from one session to the next. Flash cookies, known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit. Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html. If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Site may not function properly.
Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in our web pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the TheMovieNation Applications, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
HTML5. We use HTML5 in the TheMovieNation Applications and mobile website for the iphone or ipad (and any other Apple iOS device). HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies. Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser "cookies" file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites. To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.
Web Logs. Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) and device identification in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the TheMovieNation Applications. We may track your movement within the TheMovieNation Applications, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types. This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our TheMovieNation Applications, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or device identification from the mobile device that you used to access our TheMovieNation Applications and usage and browsing habits. We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our TheMovieNation Applications, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.
Information You Provide About a Third Party
If you send someone else a communication from the TheMovieNation Applications, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. If that person becomes a subscriber to our publications, his/her information will be treated in the same manner as all other subscribers. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the TheMovieNation Applications, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.
Information We Collect From Third Parties
We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic and lifestyle information. We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.
Third Party Analytics Technologies
