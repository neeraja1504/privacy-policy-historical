For each visit to theiapolis.com a given amount of information is collected and stored on our servers. No more information is collected than is typically collected in server logs by web sites in general.
Click-stream data:
URI of requested resource:
The full URI requested by the user. This mean the full address of the page being requested. This information is only used for statistics purpose to determine which parts of our site are the most visited. This information is never linked to an individually identified person.
Request timestamp:
Time that the request was processed by the server. We use this information to watch the evolution of visits along days, weeks and months. For example this helps us to schedule maintenance operations. This information is never linked to an individually identified person.
Client's IP address:
The IP (Internet Protocol) address of the user's computer. This data is anonymous. It is simply a number in the form xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx. In theory it is possible to find exactly who you are, or more precisely, where you are, thanks to this number. However, in practice this data can only be used to record the number of unique visitors and their country or origin. That is all. As with all the other information we collect, it is never linked to any individually identified person. We only use this information in a global way to know how many visitors are from the USA, Canada, France, UK, and so on. This helps us to determine the kind of audience of our site and thus to customize as much as possible and to match visitors' interests.

HTTP status code generated by the server for the response. Status codes allows tracking possible missing files or broken links (well known 404 error).
HTTP protocol elements:
User agent information:
The client description string sent by most Web browsers, giving the type, version, and platform type of the user's Web browser. This is sent by clients as the User-Agent: HTTP header. This information is used for statistics to know how many visitors are using Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, etc. We also use this information to customize HTML pages. It happens that sometimes Web browsers do not interpret an HTML code exactly the same way. So with this information we can serve pages that are compatible with visitor's Web browser.
Last URI requested by the user:
This is sent by clients as the Referer: HTTP header. This data is not linked to an individually identified person and is only used to know from where visitors are coming and how they browse our site.
