NOTICE:
TheLibertyMan.com Will Provide You with Notice About Its PII Collection Practices upon request.
When you voluntarily provide PII to TheLibertyMan.com, we will attempt to ensure that you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses TheLibertyMan.com will make of the information.
At the time you provide your PII, TheLibertyMan.com will normally notify you of your options regarding our use of PII, including whether we will share it with outside companies. This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore may want to share your personal information, provided you have given TheLibertyMan.com permission to do so (see "Use" below) .
Sometimes we may collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format or off-line, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.
TheLibertyMan.com's web site(s) may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a TheLibertyMan.com logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by TheLibertyMan.com. TheLibertyMan.com's web site(s) also may carry advertisements from other companies. TheLibertyMan.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our site(s) or for the privacy practices of third party or national Internet advertising companies.

If TheLibertyMan.com obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is governed by this Policy.  Moreover, we will never have your credit card information because we use PayPal to process all online transactions via their secure servers.
TheLibertyMan.com employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. TheLibertyMan.com may share your PII with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses) but they may only use your PII to provide TheLibertyMan.com with a specific service and not for any other purpose.
TheLibertyMan.com may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows TheLibertyMan.com to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on our web sites. Your non-PII and click stream data about your activities on our sites may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. These companies will not share your information with any third party or use it for any other purposes. Anonymous click stream and demographic information may also be shared with TheLibertyMan.com's advertisers and business partners.
There may be instances when TheLibertyMan.com may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of TheLibertyMan.com, their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our web sites; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if TheLibertyMan.com sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, TheLibertyMan.com may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.
