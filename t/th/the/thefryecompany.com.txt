Our Privacy Policy | FRYE Since 1863
Home /  Our Privacy Policy
WE, AT FRYE, VALUE YOUR PRIVACY. TheFryeCompany.com allows you to buy Frye products, enter occasional contests, receive special discounts, fill out surveys, and receive newsletters, e-mails and other promotional information from us.
We use the information that we collect about you to fulfill your purchases and to create a more personalized online experience. This policy may change from time to time. All changes will be posted on thefryecompany.com as indicated in Section 9 below.
Information
Types of Information
In order to better provide you with products and services, thefryecompany.com collects two types of information about its visitors: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth and customized experience while using thefryecompany.com.
In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by established third party banking, processing agents and distribution institutions. They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order.
Personally Identifiable Information
This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personal information is requested when you order a product or service, enter contests or sweepstakes, fill out surveys, and send us feedback. For example, this information might include your name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit/debit card or other payment information, and product details. With this information, we can fill your orders, and better provide you with personalized services.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. thefryecompany.com gathers certain information about you based upon where you shop on it in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis.
For example, this information may include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website from which you came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the World Wide Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination.
In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.
Product Reviews
If you choose to submit a product review on thefryecompany.com, we may ask you for information such as your name and city of residence, which may be used in connection with your review (altogether, the “Review Information”). By submitting the Review Information, you consent to our use, modification, reproduction, transmission, publication and display of such Review Information on thefryecompany.com and also in connection with the promotion, marketing and advertising of our products and services; however, we are under no obligation to post any Review Information.
Information Sharing
The Frye Company shares information with third party companies such as credit/debit card processing centers, and shipping carriers employed by The Frye Company to perform functions on its behalf including order fulfillment, postal and email delivery, and credit processes. The only information shared with these third parties is that information which is necessary to process your order.
The Frye Company may share your personal information with its affiliated companies and subsidiaries for marketing reasons. We reserve the right to share information with third party marketers, but only as permitted by law, and will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of such information sharing. We reserve the right to disclose your information as required by law, and when we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us.

You have the ability to access and edit the personal information that you have provided to thefryecompany.com.

We encourage you to promptly update your information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past purchases, you cannot delete information associated with past purchases.
