| Privacy policy: (It's really a shame that these sorts of things have become such an absolute prerequisite on the Web-a sad testament to some of the unsavory online techniques that have cropped up in recent years. At any rate...) Alarm Clock Communications respects the privacy of the personal information you provide us. Currently, the only information that we gather from Web users is a) data volunteered in our online subscription form, and b) contact information which accompanies submissions sent by readers. In both cases, any personal information you give us will be kept in the utmost confidence, shared with nobody outside Alarm Clock Communications.
alarm:clock digital is in its beta stage. Future iterations of alarm:clock digital will make use of cutting-edge tracking and information-gathering technologies (you know, cookies and the like) so that we can keep track of user statistics and ensure the best possible Web experience. We will NOT use these technologies to infringe upon the privacy of our users.
Disclaimer: Our lawyers have instructed us to include the following disclaimer (and you will probably need to retain our lawyers to figure out what it means): The data, information, views, opinions, and recommendations provided by Alarm Clock Communications should be used for informational purposes only. Alarm Clock Communications shall not be held liable for any inaccuracies, errors in transmission or omissions, or delays in the content, or for any actions taken in reliance thereon.
