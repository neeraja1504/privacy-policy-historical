We do collect and sometimes share information, such as anonymous statistical or de-identified information, about your visit with companies with which we have partnered. Schools shall have in place a policy to address the use of, and access to, confidential information that identifies a student (“Student Information”) and are responsible for configuring roles based access to Student Information in the CompassLearning Odyssey and Renzulli Learning in accordance with its policy.
CompassLearning shall maintain Student Information for and on behalf of you – in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1232g(a)(4)(A)(ii), 1232g(b)(1) – for the primary purpose of providing assessment and research services pursuant to this EULA. As between you and CompassLearning, you retain ownership of the Student Information.
We may share Student Information with your school. Teachers, administrators and district administrators can configure reports based on Student Information. These reports can be exported to PDF’s or spreadsheets. We may also share Student Information with researchers or analysts who have agreed in writing to protect the confidentiality of such information in order for them to prepare white papers or analysis regarding the efficacy of our products or services. No white papers or analysis shared publicly would disclose any Student Information. Except solely as allowed by FERPA, authorized by you, provided herein or in the CompassLearning End User License Agreement (together, the “EULA”), we will not sell, lease or provide any third party Student Information we may collect from you except pursuant to a written confidentiality agreement as necessary to make one of our products or services available to you, in connection with a sale or change of control of CompassLearning or any of its assets, or if CompassLearning has reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone damaging, injuring, or interfering with our rights, property, or users.
CompassLearning employees and employees of CompassLearning and its affiliates’ contractors shall be deemed school officials for the purpose of access to Student Information if they have a legitimate interest in maintaining, organizing, or analyzing the data for assessment and research purposes under the EULA. You are responsible for any notices to parents required under FERPA and for providing parents/guardians with an opportunity to inspect and challenge the contents of the student records in question.
In addition, if you are using a module of functionality made available by a third party that is not integrated in a CompassLearning or Renzulli product, including, for example, an assessment tool or a foreign language module, such third party may collect Student Information from you and/or we may share Student Information with such third party, in each case in order for you to receive such service.
