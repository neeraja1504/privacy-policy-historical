Except as disclosed in this Privacy Statement, we do not sell or disclose information that identifies our users of the BlogHer Network personally or makes it possible for other parties to contact them directly (" Personal Information "). We also collect non-personal information (" Anonymous Information "), such as pages visited, on the BlogHer Network. We may also collect or develop aggregated information, which may include Anonymous Information and Personal Information, provided that such information does not personally identify you or any of our other users (" Aggregated Information ").
