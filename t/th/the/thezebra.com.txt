In Plain English

How Does The Zebra Use Personal Information?
Except as otherwise set forth herein, or in any applicable Terms of Service, Personal Information and Location Based Information that you provide will be used to support your relationship with The Zebra and our products and services or partners. Among other things, we want to help you quickly find information through our Service, leverage our tools in connection with your authorized use of our products and services, process payment, facilitate interaction with third party services, and alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new products and services from The Zebra.
We also use information to perform data analyses (including market and consumer research, trend analysis, financial analysis, and anonymization of personal information), protect against, identify and prevent fraud and other criminal activity, claims and other liabilities, and comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards and our policies.
The Zebra may use Location Based Information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve, market or promote its products (including without limitation to comply with applicable laws or regulations related to insurance) or to provide services or technologies to you. The Zebra may also sell or license Location Based Information regarding its users to third parties, including Service Providers, but not in a manner in which the recipient will be able to identify you personally. You acknowledge that certain information or content that you provide in connection with the Service may inherently allow or help third parties to personally identify you.
In Plain English
We use your personal info to make The Zebra’s services better or more accurate. In some cases, your personal info will be shared with & used to help connect you with our partners.
Sharing Of Personal Information
The Zebra may share Personal Information or Location Based Information it collects about you to or with third parties, but only if we believe based upon your actions (including your actions and submissions via our Website) that the third party may have products or services that specifically interest you. Personal Information and Location Based Information collected from you is commonly used to provide you with products and services and to comply with any requirements of law.
Agents or contractors of The Zebra may have access to your Personal Information and Location Based Information on a need-to-know basis for the purpose of performing services on behalf of The Zebra. All such agents or contractors who have access to such information are asked to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing or as otherwise required by law.
We may also share certain Personal Information or Location Based Information with institutions providing possible product offerings to you based on the information you submit through the Website (e.g. financial institutions and/or insurance companies), and/or certain The Zebra vendors in order to allow them to use that information to obtain and provide us with additional information about you, and/or product offerings that might be of interest to you. In the case of insurance companies, Personal Information that is shared by us may be used by such insurance companies to “soft pull” your credit report. Note that any such reports would be pulled directly by the applicable insurance company and not by The Zebra.  A “soft pull” would not negatively impact your credit report, but once you choose to proceed with an insurance carrier, they may pull additional credit reports. The pulling of any such reports would be governed by the applicable insurance company’s own privacy policy, as addressed in the “Third-Party Websites, Services and Applications” section of this Privacy Policy.
The Zebra or its agents or contractors may disclose Personal Information or Location Based Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of The Zebra or its agents or contractors; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public.
Finally, if The Zebra should ever merge with another organization, file for bankruptcy, or sell our assets, we may transfer the information you provide to us on through the Service to a third party or share your Personal Information to the company with which we enter into such transaction as a part of such transaction.
Notice To California Residents: Subject to certain limits under California Civil Code § 1798.83, California residents may ask us to provide them with (i) a list of certain categories of personal information that we have disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, and (ii) the identity of those third parties. To make this request, California residents may contact us as specified in the How to Contact Us section below.
In Plain English
Our agents might have access to your personal details in order to do their jobs: but they’ll do their best to keep it confidential. While it might be necessary to share your info to use our services, we take your personal information seriously and will not sell it indiscriminately. We can disclose personal details if the law tells us too, to protect ourselves, or in the interest of public or user safety. Some carriers may "soft pull" your credit when requesting initial quotes on The Zebra, but this alone does not negatively impact your credit. Finally, if our organization goes through a giant transition like bankruptcy or a merger, we might transfer your info.
Security of Your Information
We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect Personal Information, and our systems are designed to protect Personal Information from unauthorized usage on shared computers in that users are required to log in through our applications.
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose Personal Information through public facing aspects of the Service, through e-mail, or in chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others.

We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any Personal Information you choose to submit in connection with these public features.
We may send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in the event of a security breach. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.

We work hard to keep your info private. However, because the Internet can never be 100 percent secure, you give us your info at your own risk. When you put your personal info out there, it can be collected and used by others. We’re not responsible for keeping any of that information private or secure. If we have a security breach, we may email you (which could be required by law, depending on where you live).

Remarketing and Retargeting
The Zebra uses third-party remarketing services (such as Google AdWords, AdRoll, & Facebook) to advertise on third-party websites to previous visitors of TheZebra.com or our properties. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement or posting on the Google search results page, Facebook, or various other websites within these networks or on the worldwide web. Third-party vendors use cookies, advertising identifiers and other technologies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to the The Zebra’s properties. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and the privacy policies of these third-party remarketing services. You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you by visiting the consumer opt-out page for the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and edit or opt-out your Google Display Network ads’ preferences at http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/. AdRoll preferences or settings can be adjusted at http://info.evidon.com/pub_info/573?v=1&nt=1&nw=false. For general or other consumer opt-out, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices.
We use Remarketing with Google Analytics, which allows us to display ads to you based upon your activities within the Service using cookies and advertising identifiers on your device. You may opt out of certain Google Analytics Advertising Features by visiting https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.
Our websites are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from browsers.

We often use tools for the purpose of remarketing to you on third-party websites.

Many of these tools offer you the ability to adjust your advertising preferences or to opt-out altogether.
