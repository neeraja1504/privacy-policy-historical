Collection and Use of Personal Information About Customers
When you place an order with us you will be asked to enter your name, address, email address and a contact phone number as well as a password. This will create a user account for you which will allow you to track the progress of your order and will enable you to make future purchases more easily. By submitting your personal data, you agree to the transfer and storing or processing of this information. By ticking the tick box to receive promotional e-mails, you agree to receive marketing communications from T. H. Baker and associated companies. We do not ask you for your payment card information at this point, so no financial information is stored in your user account.
The information we learn from customers when they place an order helps us personalise and forever improve your shopping experience with us. We use personal information we collect from you, or that you provide to us, to: handle orders; deliver products and services; process payments; contact you about orders, products, services, special offers and promotional activities; update our records; to improve our store and platform; prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our website; and to enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf. Any third parties must use the information in accordance with this privacy notice and as permitted by the UK's Data Protection Act 1998.
Confidentiality
We will only release personal information when we feel it is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property or safety of houseofwatches.co.uk, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purpose of fraud protection and credit risk reduction. However, this does not include selling, sharing or otherwise disclosing personal information about customers for commercial purposes.
Controlling Your Personal Information
You may choose to restrict the use of your personal information and opt out of receiving direct email marketing communications from us. When you are asked to provide information on the website, look for a tick box that you can tick or untick to indicate your preferences.
Alternatively, if you have already signed up to receive emails from The Jewel Hut, please note that you can unsubscribe from our mailing list at any time by clicking the link available in all outgoing e-mails. Otherwise, you can request to be removed from our mailing list by emailing sales@houseofwatches.co.uk, calling us on 01384 78431 or making the request in writing to the following address:
