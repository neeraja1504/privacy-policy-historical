DoubleClick DART Cookies

This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”).

DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers.
