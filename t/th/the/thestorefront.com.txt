Privacy Policy
Last Updated: May 25, 2018
This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, process, and disclose your information, including personal information, in connection with your access to and use of the Storefront Platform. If you see an undefined term in this Privacy Policy (such as “Listing” or “Storefront Platform”), it has the same definition as in our Terms of Service.
When this policy mentions “Storefront,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” it refers to Popup Immo (DBA Storefront), the company that is responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy (the “Data Controller”).
1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
There are three general categories of information we collect.
1.1 Information You Give to Us.
1.1.1 Information that is necessary for the use of the Storefront Platform.
We ask for and collect certain personal information about you when you use the Storefront Platform. This information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and Storefront and to allow us to comply with our legal obligations. Without it, we may not be able to provide you with all of the requested services.
Account Information.  When you sign up for a Storefront Account, we require certain information such as your name, company name, email address, and phone number.
Profile and Listing Information.  To use certain features of the Storefront Platform (such as booking or creating a Listing), we may ask you to provide additional information, such as your address or phone number.
Identity Verification Information.  To create and maintain a trusted environment, we may collect identity verification information or other authentication information, such as your date of birth.
Communications with Storefront and other users.  When you communicate with Storefront or use the Storefront Platform to communicate with others, we collect information about your communication and any information you choose to provide.
Payment Information.  To use certain features of the Storefront Platform (such as booking or creating a Listing), we may require you to provide certain financial information (like your bank account or credit card information) in order to facilitate the processing of payments and to comply with applicable law (such as anti-money laundering regulations). Without it, you may not be able to use the Platform to book or rent out space.
1.1.2 Information you choose to give us.
You may choose to provide us with additional personal information in order to obtain a better user experience when using Storefront Platform. This additional information will be processed based on your consent.
Additional Profile Information.  You may choose to provide additional information as part of your Storefront profile (such as preferred language(s) or descriptions of your brand and/or space).
Other Information.  You may otherwise choose to provide us information when you fill in a form, conduct a search, update or add information to your Storefront Account, respond to surveys, or use other features of the Storefront Platform.
1.2 Information We Automatically Collect from Your Use of the Storefront Platform.
When you use the Storefront Platform, we automatically collect information, including personal information, about the services you use and how you use them. This information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, to enable us to comply with legal obligations and pursuant to our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the functionalities of the Storefront Platform.
Usage Information.  We collect information about your interactions with the Storefront Platform such as the pages or content you view, your searches for Listings, bookings you have made, and other actions on the Storefront Platform.
Log Data and Device Information.  We automatically collect log data and device information when you access and use the Storefront Platform, even if you have not created a Storefront Account or logged in. That information includes, among other things: details about how you’ve used the Storefront Platform (including if you clicked on links to third party applications), IP address, access dates and times, hardware and software information, device information, device event information, unique identifiers, crash data, cookie data, and the pages you’ve viewed or engaged with before or after using the Storefront Platform.
Cookies and Similar Technologies.  We use cookies and other similar technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, and mobile identifiers. We may also allow our business partners to use these tracking technologies on the Storefront Platform, or engage others to track your behavior on our behalf. While you may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings, it may affect your ability to log in to your account and use the Site. The Storefront Platform currently does not respond to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from your browser or mobile application due to lack of standardization regarding how that signal should be interpreted.
1.3 Information We Collect from Third Parties.
Storefront may collect information, including personal information, that others provide about you when they use the Storefront Platform, or obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the Storefront Platform and the Payment Services. We do not control, supervise or respond for how the third parties providing your information process your personal data, and any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information to us should be directed to such third parties.
Social Sign In.  If you link, connect, or login to your Storefront Account with a social networking site such as Facebook, Facebook may send us information such as your registration and profile information from that service. This information varies and is controlled by that Facebook and/or as authorized by you via your privacy settings with Facebook.
Other Sources.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data or fraud detection information, from third party service providers and/or partners, and combine it with information we have about you. For example, we may receive background check results (with your consent where required) or fraud warnings from service providers like identity verification services for our fraud prevention and risk assessment efforts.

However, attribution of such information to you will be removed. Additionally, some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers.
Because we maintain the Storefront Platform to protect from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.

Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to the processing pursuant to Section 6.6 and pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of Storefront override your own.
6.6 Objection to Processing.
In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require Storefront not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes (including profiling) where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing Storefront will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
