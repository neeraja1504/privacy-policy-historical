Privacy Statement | Thebestonlinevideos.com
Can I remove a video where the ownership belongs to me?
Absolutely. If you are a copyright holder of a video that’s featured on Thebestonlinevideos.com, and you don’t wish for it to remain on the site, simply follow the DMCA procedure outlined here. However, please note that due to limited man power, and the volume of requests that we receive on a variety of issues daily, we may not always provide a reply to your request. Rest assured your video will be expeditiously removed. Please check back later, and the URL of your video will either lead to the front page of thebestonlinevideos.com (that’s our 404 redirect), or the video page will indicate “Removed at owner’s request”.
In addition, we ask that you understand the following: Under Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.
No information is sold or released to anyone about visitors to Thebestonlinevideos.com without prior consent or a court order. In other words, no information is released to anyone unless you give permission first.
Thebestonlinevideos.comÂ does not attempt to collect personal information from children. Note that Â Thebestonlinevideos.comÂ cannot always determine that a user is a child. Â Thebestonlinevideos.comÂ does not maintain databases of children or adults.
When visiting any Internet site, your unique address called an â€œIP addressâ€ is recorded. Â Thebestonlinevideos.comÂ does not release any information about the collection of this address to any third party except under court order.Â Thebestonlinevideos.comÂ archives the log files in order to create aggregate statistical reports, detect errors on the web site, and for security reasons. The log files are eventually deleted.
IP reports for advertisement clicks are shared with the advertiser. However, they usually have this information already since it is captured by their server when you view or click an ad. This is done to verify billing for the ads. No additional information associated with any specific user is provided to the advertisers.
