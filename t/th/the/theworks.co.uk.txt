We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site use, which enables us to improve the service we provide.
Use of your information and your preferences
We will use your information to provide and personalise our services. We will also use your contact details to communicate with you. We may use your information to send you offers and news about us and our products.
We do not share personal information with third parties, except for the purposes of credit/debit card authorisation and delivery. We may contact you by post, email, telephone or fax for these purposes.

We may also use and disclose information in aggregate (so that no individual customers are identified) for marketing and strategic development purposes.
