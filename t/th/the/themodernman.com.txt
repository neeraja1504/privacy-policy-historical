SAFETY OF MINORS
Use of TheModernMan.com website is not intended for and may not be used by individuals under the age of 13 located in the United States or under the age of 16 if located outside of the United States (or under a lower age if permitted by the laws of their residence). TheModernMan.com does not knowingly collect personal data from minors or allow them to register accounts. If it comes to our attention that we have collected personal data from a minor, we may delete this information without notice.

YOUR RIGHTS
TheModernMan.com acknowledges your right to access your personal data. Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we must keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.
We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (e.g. developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).
Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.
You have the right to request information about the personal data we hold on you. If your data is incorrect, incomplete, or irrelevant you can ask to have the information corrected or removed. To access or update your personal information, email privacy@themodernman.com with your current contact information and the personal information you would like to access. We will provide you the personal information requested if reasonably available, or will describe the types of personal information we typically collect.
Customers Located in the EEA
Notwithstanding the above, customers located in the EEA may exercise any of the rights described in this section by sending an email to privacy@themodernman.com. Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before taking further action on your request.
Managing Your Information
You may access and update some of your information, including personal information, through your TheModernMan.com account. You are responsible for keeping your personal information up-to-date.
Rectification Of Inaccurate Or Incomplete Information
You have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information concerning you (and which you cannot update yourself within your TheModernMan.com account).
Data Access And Portability
In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to request copies of your personal information held by us.
Data Retention And Erasure
We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us and to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to use your information to provide the TheModernMan.com website to you, you can request that we erase your personal information and close your TheModernMan.com account. Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:
We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety.
We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, TheModernMan.com may keep some of your information for tax, legal and auditing obligations.
Because we maintain the TheModernMan.com website to protect from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.
Withdrawing Consent And Restriction Of Processing
Where you have provided your consent to the processing of your personal information by TheModernMan.com, you may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your account settings, or by sending a communication to TheModernMan.com specifying which consent you are withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal.

You contest the accuracy of your personal information.
The processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information.
We no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
Objection To Processing
In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require TheModernMan.com not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing, TheModernMan.com will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claim(s).
Where your personal information is processed for direct marketing purposes, you may, at any time, ask TheModernMan.com to cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes by emailing privacy@themodernman.com.
