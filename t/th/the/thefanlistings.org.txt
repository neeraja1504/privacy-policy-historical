The Fanlistings
The Fanlistings Network ('TFL' or 'TFL.org' or 'The Fanlistings.org' or 'we' or 'us' or 'our') is committed to ensuring that our members' and applicants' privacy is protected. The document below outlines our privacy and spam policies and other information regarding the use of the TFL.org website. This document only covers the TFL network located at the domain thefanlistings.org or the subdomain board.thefanlistings.org. It does not cover the websites linked within the TFL directory, our affiliates, or third parties linked within the site.
Information Collection, Privacy and Use
The TFL network collects information from users within our site, via means including but not limited to our application forms, contact forms, update information forms, and our message board. The only information we require from users is a name and email address. We do collect an IP address from users. If a member is approved for a fanlisting, their name and email address are stored in our databases. Other emails are kept for up to three months but are then discarded. Fanlisting owners' names and email addresses are not available to visitors, but only viewable by TFL staff and senior staff. This information is used to keep in contact with fanlisting owners and will not be given out to anyone else. TFL does not sell or solicit your personal email address to any person or business entity.
If you have any questions regarding your privacy, please contact us.
Spam
TFL.org does not condone spam and we are strong advocates of a spam-free internet. By submitting an application form to TFL, the user gives consent for the TFL staff member to approve them for a fanlisting and therefore be sent emails regarding the status of the fanlisting (i.e. troubles emails, removal emails, etc.). By submitting a contact form inquiry, the user gives TFL consent to contact them regarding the inquiry if they provide an return email address. The TFL message board requires a working email address to join, however all other information is optional. If the user so wishes, they can hide their email address from the public. However, it will be available to the TFL senior staff.
Links to Third-Party Sites and Adult Content
We provide links to other World Wide Web sites or resources. We do not control these sites and resources, do not endorse them, and are not responsible for any aspects of those sites, including their availability, content, accuracy, legality, or delivery of services. You waive any claim resulting from your exposure to material on or through TFL that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable. You should be of legal age in your country, state, or community to view adult-oriented areas of TFL.
TFL.org may contain some material that is inappropriate for young audiences. There are a number of ways you can control what your child can see and do online. You may wish to consider utilising filtering software to manage your child's online experience.
TFL.org lists several 'fanlistings' for subjects that may be of a questionable or controversial nature. Although these are 'listed' at this Network, and the fanlistings may claim to be "approved by" or the "official" fanlisting for that subject, TFL does not endorse these subjects. TFL.org, the TFL senior staff, and the TFL staff and volunteers do not have any affiliation with, endorsement of, or approval of these subjects outside of them being listed at our network.
Surveys
TFL may hold surveys or polls for our users occassionally. Involvement or feedback in these surveys or polls is voluntary and the user may choose not to disclose their email address, name or other personal information. Users will be informed if their IP address is being collected.
Agreement to Submission Policies and Staffer Guidelines
In addition to these terms, if you submit a site for possible inclusion in TFL, you agree to comply with and be bound by TFL listing policies. In addition, if you apply and are selected to become a category staffer, developer or senior staffer at TFL, you agree to comply with and be bound by the TFL staffer guidelines.
Concerns of Copyright Infringement
If you feel a site listed at the TFL.org directory is breaching copyright of your or your clients' material, please read the following:
TFL.org is simply a website directory for fanlistings. Although we do require our listees to follow certain guidelines, we have no way of knowing if content or material used on our listees' sites is illegal. We do take claims of this nature seriously, but do suggest that the owner of this material either:
contacts the website owner's host to report this abuse (or)
contacts the owner of the site itself to ask this material is removed (or)
contacts the owner of the site itself to ask that a legal disclaimer is put up
Often the website owner is making a site to show their admiration for the subject of the fanlisting and does not mean to break copyright (in the case of use of images or biography). However, if you feel the website owner is breaking copyright with intent, we do encourage contacting the host.

If you have any questions or comments, please use our contact form to send them.
