Thexyz Privacy Policy
Our privacy policy is really simple, we believe your data is your data and you own that data, here you can read more about it including the privacy of your account , payment information, registration data and our cookies.
Last updated: March 14th 2013   PRIVACY OF YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS We use encrypted SSL connection to process your credit card information and DO NOT store any of your payment details in our system. The payments are carried out in the background by the PayPal payment processing gateway and go through the HSBC bank’s terminal. Working with the two leaders in online payment operations, we guarantee fast and secure processing of your payment. Not only do we NOT make a record of your credit card details in our system, but also – for maximum online security – we do NOT share this information with any third party. PRIVACY OF YOUR ACCOUNT We consider your registration data and the content of all your messages private and confidential. Our ad-free webmail does not have any tracking built into it. We do not participate in, or co-operate with, any kind of blanket surveillance or monitoring.

ensuring encrypted access for webmail, IMAP and POP.
using Perfect Forward Secrecy where possible for encrypted connections.
using encrypted SMTP for sending your mail when the receiving server supports it.
encrypting email while at rest on our servers.
encrypting communications between our data centres.
The header of the messages that you send will contain your name (e-mail address) and Internet Protocol (IP) address. We will not monitor or disclose any of your email content or registration data unless we are required to do so: by law, to defend ourselves in any legal action, or to protect our property. Unless prohibited by law, we will disclose to the account holder when we receive a warrant for their account.   Since your password is essential for protecting your privacy, we encourage you to NOT share it with anyone and change it frequently. Additionally, you agree to respect the privacy and confidentiality of others. PRIVACY OF YOUR REGISTRATION DATA Thexyz collects certain information during the registration process.
