TNS is committed to protecting your privacy in a number of ways including using industry accepted security measures to protect against loss, misuse and alteration of data in our systems. This statement is designed to describe how we secure and maintain your personal data when you visit our Site or when your personal data is collected during your use of the Site.

COLLECTION AND USE OF DATA
Data Collected from You
Data You Provide Us. We collect data directly from you when you sign up to receive our products. For instance, if you request to receive an ebook or newsletter, you are required to provide your email address, so we may send you the ebook or newsletter requested. Similarly, if you email us with a request, comment or concern, we will collect your email address, name and other information so we may address the issue. Additionally, if you provide us with your email address, we may, from time-to-time, send you a survey or questionnaire which you may voluntarily respond to and may, at your choice, provide certain personal information.
Data Automatically Collected. Whenever you interact with the Site, we automatically receive and record certain information. This information may include server logs from your browser including your IP address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, “cookie” information, and the page you requested. We store this information in log files and do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.
Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by us and our partners, affiliates, analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Site, tracking users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. “Cookies” are small text files stored on a user’s computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize your browser or mobile device and tell us how and when pages on the Site are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or mobile device to prevent or limit your computer or device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may limit you from taking advantage of some of our Site’s features.
Also, if you click on a link to a third party site (for example a promoted event), such third party may also transmit cookies to you. This statement does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.
How We Use Your Data
We use your data to provide you with products and services your request including ebooks and newsletters, responding to inquiries or requests, and displaying content based upon your interests. In addition, we may use your data to market our and sponsors’ products, promotions, and offers which we feel you may find interesting, provided you have not opted out of receiving such information or, where required by law, we have your express consent. We may also use your data to understand general trends and patterns and improve our Site.
How We Share Your Data
Third Party Service Providers. We may disclose your personal data to third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf including third parties that send marketing communications on our behalf (such as Mailchimp) and help us create or maintain our databases or help us research or analyze use of the Site (such as Google Analytics). We require our service providers get your prior consent to use your data to market their own products or services to you directly. When we transfer any of your personal data to a service provider, the provider will be contractually required to use your data only to carry out the services we have requested, to provide appropriate protection of your data and to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
Third Party Partners. We do not share your data with our third party partners including our sponsors.
To Comply with Legal Process. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We reserve the right to disclose your personal data as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us.
Third Parties to a Business Transaction. In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal data will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent notice on our Platforms for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal data.
Where we want to share data with third parties not described above, we will obtain your consent to do so.
