Privacy Policy - TheLayoff.com
The very mission of TheLayoff.com is predicated upon the anonymity of its users. Therefore, we at TheLayoff.com give utmost importance to the privacy of our visitors.
We offer a platform for public forum-like communication without requiring user registration. However, as is true of all web surfing and the Internet in general, by browsing our site visitors leave footprints in form of server log files and cookies. Even though we do not require registration and allow you to be an anonymous (i.e. nameless) poster, these footprints may be considered as personal information (although this may or may not be sufficient to identify you). This document is about the types of information we collect and lays down our stance in safeguarding this information.
1. Log Data
This section lists the types of user data we record, hereinafter referred to as log data.
1.1 HTTP Request Data
As with most other websites, we collect and use some of the data your browser automatically submits to the server when browsing the website. This data is typically stored in server log files. The HTTP request data we may record include your IP (internet protocol) address.
1.2 Cookies
As most websites, we use cookies to improve user experience, as well as for the statistical analysis of user browsing.
1.3 Signed-in User Information
Although signing in is not required in order to use TheLayoff.com, it may offer some benefits to the user, such as personalization of user experience. By signing in, the users share their email address with us. Email address is thus added to the list of types of log data we record. However, as with HTTP request data and cookies, the user's email address associated with his account is considered private information: it is never displayed on the website.
2. Third Party Cookies and Web Beacons
In addition to the cookies we use directly, your browser may receive third party cookies. These cookies are not part of our log data (i.e. we do not record any information about them), and we have no direct control over them.
We use third party advertisements on TheLayoff.com to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
We use Google Analytics for statistical traffic analysis. Google Analytics uses cookies of its own (separate from Google AdSense).
This is ubiquitous practice on the Web: you are routinely exposed to this kind of cookies when you browse any website that uses Google Analytics, or any website showing third party advertisements (such as Google AdSense).
3. Disclosure of Log Data
We never sell log data to third parties.
Although we strive to preserve the privacy of our visitors, there are situations in which we are faced with the issue of log data disclosure.
3.1 Legal Situations
As we are bound by applicable laws, we may disclose log data in order to comply with a legally enforceable subpoena, warrant, court order, or other judicial or administrative order.
3.2 Emergency Situations
Situations involving potential threats to personal safety may arise. Upon evaluating these situations in good faith, we may disclose log data.
