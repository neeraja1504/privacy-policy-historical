Our website may also use a website recording service which may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, page scrolling and any text keyed into website forms. Data collected by this service is used to improve our website usability. The information collected is stored and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting, and is not shared with anybody else.
We collect information for the following purposes:
To deliver orders placed by you
To verify your payment details and prevent fraudulent transactions

To contact you in the event of a problem with your order
Where your consent has been given, to contact you with alerts, offers and promotions
We use the very latest 128bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that your payment information is safely encrypted, making it virtually impossible for unauthorised access to your details.

Security
We work with the best online security partners to ensure that your payment details are safely encrypted and protected using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. This means you cannot inadvertently send private information through an unsecure connection. When sending private data look out for the padlock sign at the foot of your browser – the root of our URL will also change from HTTP to HTTPS.
In addition to encrypting your information and using the latest SSL technology, we also provide an additional layer of payment card security, established by the world’s leading payment system providers to protect consumers from unauthorised payments:
Verified by Visa
Verified by Visa provides an additional password-protected level of security when using your Visa card for online purchases. You can sign up for Verified by Visa next time you place an order with us or alternatively, contact your payment card provider directly to set up the service. Once signed up, your internet purchases on 1000’s of websites will be protected by an additional level of authentication. When using Verified by Visa you’ll be asked to enter a password, known only to yourself, in addition to the normal payment card details asked for when making a purchase.
MasterCard SecureCode
MasterCard SecureCode is a service that password-protects your MasterCard /Maestro payment card details, giving you added security when shopping online. The service allows you to create a password that is known only to yourself, to use every time you use your card online.
To register for MasterCard SecureCode all you need to do is follow the instructions next time you place an order with us. Alternatively, you can sign up by contacting the bank that issued your Mastercard/Maestro card directly. You will be asked to create a password (also known as a SecureCode) for your payment card. You only need to do this once then whenever you use the card online you will be asked to enter the password when you check out. If you have already registered, you will be prompted to enter your SecureCode when you order. To find out more information about these services visit the MasterCard SecureCode website.
