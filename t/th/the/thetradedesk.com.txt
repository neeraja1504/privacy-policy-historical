BACKGROUND REGARDING OUR TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES .
The Trade Desk, Inc. (“we”, “us”, or “our”) provides an online advertising and technology platform and we are headquartered in the United States. We provide this privacy policy to inform you about how we collect and use data on our corporate website, which is located at www.thetradedesk.com (the “Website”), and how our technology platform and related technology, such as pixels` (“Technology”) processes information on behalf of online advertisers, website owners, data providers and other businesses that use our services (those online advertisers and their agencies who use our technology are defined as our “Clients”). If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at privacy@thetradedesk.com. The Trade Desk runs a buying platform for media and data. The Trade Desk Technology allows our Clients to buy ad space on websites, in apps, and on other digital platforms, and allows for the use of proprietary and third party data in the purchase of that ad space. When ad space is bought or sold digitally (usually to an advertiser or ad agency by a publisher or other content provider) the Technology, fulfills the transaction by delivering the ad to internet and mobile users who visit that site, use that application, or watch certain videos (for example). Generally, an Internet user’s computer, browser or device comes into contact with The Trade Desk when a user views an ad delivered or serviced by or with our Technology. Serving users relevant advertising is sometimes referred to as interest based advertising or online behavioral advertising (“OBA”).
PRIVACY PRACTICES FOR OUR TECHNOLOGY
Information Our Technology Collects. We believe that consumers prefer more (rather than less) relevant ads, tailored to their interests. To do this, we collect a variety of data from Clients, from data suppliers, and across platforms, to help optimize ads and increase the likelihood that a particular unique, but pseudonymous, user will be interested in (rather than potentially annoyed by) an ad shown. For more information on the technology used to collect the below information, please refer to the below section titled “Cookies, Web Beacons and Mobile SDKs.”
• Our Technology collects information generally known as non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”) that may include, but is not limited to, your IP host address, the date and time of the ad request, specific location information of your device (which may be derived from, for example, your device’s GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals), pages viewed, browser type, the referring URL, Internet Service Provider, and your computer’s operating system, as well as how you interact with a web page or ad. We may also collect Non-PII such as age, gender, income, education, interests, and usage activity from Clients or other third parties. We also may collect analogous Non-PII from mobile platforms, which may include information about your interactions with those applications (including your IP address and time-stamp information), and information about your mobile device (including device type, handset name, operating system information, mobile identifiers such as Apple IDFA and Android Advertising ID, app-specific identifiers, and a list of the applications your device interacts with).
• Sometimes, we obtain the above information from other ad platforms, application platforms or providers, customers or websites and services (including our Clients). We may work with Clients or other third parties to synchronize or “sync” unique, pseudonymous identifiers to match our Clients’ Non-PII data or identifiers to our own, in order to enhance data points about a particular unique browser or device, and thus enable or send ads that are more relevant, match consumers to their likely product interests, or better synchronize, cap, or otherwise optimize advertising.
How We Use Information Our Technology Collects
The Trade Desk uses Non-PII to target and serve or to help our Clients to target and serve relevant advertising to consumers and to perform attribution analysis or other analytics regarding advertising audiences, as well as to compile, match and link audiences on behalf of Clients. For instance, we may, or help our Clients to, use this Non-PII to:
• Determine what ad to show a consumer, and customize ads to particular types of audiences;
• Customize ads to the type of web page users are viewing;
• Limit the number of times a consumer sees an ad or a type of ad;
• Perform analysis of how effective the ads are;
• Help advertisers learn more about their own consumers;
• Troubleshooting; and
• Fraud detection
Sometimes we may use or make available to Clients products or services from third parties that utilize their data and the Non-PII we collect or receive (such as IP Address) to recognize users or try to resolve a commonality of users (or households) across platforms or across devices, such as smartphones, computers, tablets or related browsers or to connect app usage to browser usage on the same device. For instance, we might infer that a common IP address seen across different devices represents a common user (or a related or similar user), and use that inference in tailoring ads. Occasionally, we receive data sets (which may constitute hashed or obfuscated personally identifiable information (“PII”)), in order to promote, test or validate the accuracy of such inferences.
We do not knowingly collect or obtain from third parties, any personal data, including any “sensitive personal data,” for OBA purposes, as defined under Directive 95/46/EC, and we contractually prohibit third parties from putting this data in our platform.
In adherence to EDAA requirements, we do not create segments for OBA purposes that are specifically designed to target children (age 12 and under). While this does not mean that ad delivery will not occur, it means that we will not specifically target ads to children ages 12 and under.
Cookies, Web Beacons and Mobile SDKs
In order to help make the online advertisements more relevant to users, our Technology uses the standard “cookies” feature of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on users’ computers about users’ visits to certain websites. We also use cookies to understand users’ browsing and buying activities so that we can measure the success of online advertising campaigns we run.
Cookies are small text files that web servers typically send to users’ computer when they visit a website. Cookies are stored as text files on users’ hard drive, and can be accessed by web servers when the user visits a website or views an advertisement. Cookies are used by companies to collect and send information about a user’s website visits – for example, number of visits, average time spent, pages viewed, navigation history through the website, and other statistics. This information helps companies improve a user’s online experience in many ways: for example, by allowing companies to monitor website performance, making the website easier to use, measuring the effectiveness of their promotional placements, and tailoring their website (including the ads and offers they receive) to better match a user’s interests and preferences . Users who prefer not to accept cookies can set their Internet browser to block cookies.
The Trade Desk cookie is set to expire after one year; our opt-out cookie lasts longer. Our cookie expiration may reset upon further interaction between ourselves (or as applicable a Client) and a browser or device.
The Trade Desk also uses web beacons (also known as 1×1 gifs), along with cookies, to determine if a user has visited a particular website. These beacons aid in providing more relevant advertising to the user, as well measuring the success of an advertising campaign, but provide no personally identifiable information.
HTML5 and Locally Stored Objects. Similar to cookies are pieces of code known as “locally stored objects,” which we may also use for storing Non-PII. Locally stored objects, such as HTML5 Web Storage, are used for similar purposes as cookies but typically contain a greater amount and different types of data than browser cookies. Most current versions of common web browsers clear this locally stored data when you delete or clear your cookie cache. To confirm whether this is the case for the browser you are using, or to learn more about how to precisely control this data storage, please consult the Help function of your browser.
Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs. We may sometimes work with Clients that use mobile SDKs to collect information. A mobile SDK is the mobile app version of a pixel tag or beacon (see those descriptions, above). The SDK is a bit of computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented. We may use this technology, or work with others who use this technology, to deliver certain advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with mobile devices. If you’d like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in the “Choices” section below.
Information Sharing
The Trade Desk may share the Non-PII that we collect and receive in various ways.
• Primarily, we work with Clients and other third parties to help optimize ads and make them more likely to be relevant to consumers, by comparing, syncing and sharing the Non-PII described above. For instance, we may share to other ad platforms, customers or websites and services (including our Clients) Non-PII we have collected (generally, unique, pseudonymous identifiers representing consumers’ browsers), in order for these third parties to match their unique identifiers to our own, so that we can “sync” identifiers in order to help them show more relevant ads, match consumers to their likely interests, or better synchronize, cap, or otherwise optimize advertising.
• Further, the Non-PII we collect and receive may be processed on our behalf by third-party service providers that assist us in running our business, including providers of data storage and processing facilities.
• We may disclose your information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual activities that may harm any person, our company, the Technology, or otherwise violate any law.
• Also, in the event The Trade Desk is merged into another company, or another company acquires all or substantially all of The Trade Desk’s assets, including, without limitation, in the event of bankruptcy, all data compiled or owned by The Trade Desk may be among the items transferred in that transaction.
• We may share non-personal information with Clients, both in an aggregated and non-aggregated form, in connection with reporting and accounting needs as well as with other unaffiliated third parties for various purposes such as statistical or educational analysis (such as the creation of predictive models).
• Finally, disclosure of information may be required in response to lawful requests by public authorities, for example to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Interest-Based Advertising and Opting Out
The Trade Desk uses cookies, Web beacons, pixels and other technologies to collect web viewing data across non-affiliated sites over time. In addition, The Trade Desk collects app usage data across non-affiliated apps over time. We may also collect such Web viewing and app usage data from other ad platforms, application platforms or providers, customers or websites and services (including our Clients) and we may combine this information with any information that we have collected about you. We use this data to infer your interests and to provide more relevant advertising to you. This is known as Interest-Based Advertising (“IBA”).
We may also facilitate our Clients’ efforts to place a cookie or other tracking technology on a website with which our Client has a relationship, and we may allow our Clients to collect information about your web viewing behavior on our website. This information may be combined with other data collected from other websites over time for IBA purposes.
The Trade Desk follows the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles and the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) Code of Conduct.
Opting Out for Web-based IBA: If you’d like to opt-out from having The Trade Desk use your Web viewing data and other Non-PII for web-based IBA purposes, please click here for more information on IBA and the choices that The Trade Desk offers with respect to IBA. The DAA and NAI also provide websites where you can learn more about IBA and opt out of receiving targeted ads from our advertising partners who participate in the DAA or NAI programs. You can access these websites at www.aboutads.info/choices and at www.networkadvertising.org/choices. Residents of the EEA and Switzerland may visit www.youronlinechoices.com.If you are located in Canada, you can access this information at http://youradchoices.ca/choices/.
Opting Out for App-based IBA: If you are using a mobile device, you may be able to opt out of receiving IBA by The Trade Desk based on app usage data, through your device settings as described below. We provide the following descriptions solely for informational purposes. For additional information and up to date methods of opting out, you should consult your device settings, and instructions provided by device manufacturers. Additional information can be found at https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options.
Opting Out on iOS Devices Such as iPhones, iPads or iPods
If you have an Apple device, you can opt out of our IBA services by updating to iOS 6.0 or higher, and setting Limit Ad Tracking to ‘ON’. You can do this by clicking on Settings -> General -> About -> Advertising and toggling Limit Ad Tracking to ‘ON’. Our systems are designed to respect your choice and not use information to provide IBA when this setting is ON. Again, you should consult Apple’s support web pages and instructions for the most current applicable settings.
Opting Out on Android Devices
If you have an Android device and would like to opt out of our IBA services, you may do this as follows:
1. Open the Google Settings app on your device
2. Select Personal info & privacy à Ads settings à Manage Ad Settings
3. Turn to “off” the “Ads based on your interests” option.
Our systems are likewise designed to respect these choices transmitted by your Android device. Again, however, please consult Google’s settings and instructions for the most current settings information.
Please note that these settings do not block ads, but rather will not base ads on your interests.
Data Storage and Security
We retain the Non-PII collected via our Technology for up to eighteen months. After 18 months (or sooner) the data is stored in aggregate for up to three years.
The security of your information is important to us. The Trade Desk has implemented security measures, including physical, electronic and administrative safeguards, to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information that our Technology collects, but we make no assurances about our ability to prevent such loss, misuse, to you or to any third party arising out of any such loss, misuse, or alteration.
