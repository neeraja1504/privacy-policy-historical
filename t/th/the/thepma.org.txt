Privacy Policy | The PMA
Last Updated: June 1, 2018
The Performance Marketing Association, Inc. (“we”, “us” or “PMA”) has created this privacy policy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering, use and dissemination practices solely for the web site located at www.thepma.org and any other site or service on which a link to this policy appears (the “Site”).
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Personal Information:
Your provision of your Personal Information to us is completely voluntary. “Personal Information” is information that specifically identifies you as an individual.  We do not collect Personal Information unless you submit that information to us, such as when you choose to sign up for our newsletters or join the PMA. Categories of Personal Information we collect include:
Identity Data, which includes name or other similar identifiers.
Contact Data, which includes address, email address and telephone numbers.
Financial Data, which includes payment card details.
In addition to Identity Data and Contact Data, certain other types of data may be considered Personal Information in certain jurisdictions, namely, the European Union (“EU”), such as:
Technical Data, which includes internet protocol (IP) address, location data, your login data.
Profile Data, which ** ** includes ** ** your username and password, your interests, and preferences.
Usage Data, which includes information about how you use our web site and services.
Marketing and Communications Data, which ** ** includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us
Membership payments are processed through Stripe.  Therefore, we do not retain your payment card details, but rather pass them along to Stripe who will process the payments and use your details pursuant to their published policies at https://stripe.com/us/privacy.
Non-Personal Information:
In addition, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information (“Non-Personal Information”).  We may aggregate Personal Information so that the aggregated information does not personally identify you or anyone else, such as by using Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our customers who live in a particular area (“Aggregate Information”).  Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may collect, use and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose.  In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information.  If we combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information.
