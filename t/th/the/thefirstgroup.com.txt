One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize The First Group pages, or register with The First Group or its family of websites or services, a cookie helps The First Group to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same The First Group website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use The First Group features that you customised.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of The First Group services or its websites that you visit.
(a) third parties may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect or receive information from our website and elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads,
(b) Users can opt-out of the collection and use of information for ad targeting anytime by going to www.aboutads.info/choice and exercise their choice.
Security of your Personal Information
The First Group secures your personal information from unauthorised access, use or disclosure. The First Group secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
