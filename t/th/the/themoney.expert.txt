Cookies
Cookies are packets of information sent to your web browser and then sent back by the browser each time it accesses the server that sent the cookie. Some cookies are removed when you close your browser session. These are the “Session Cookies”. Some last for longer periods and are called “Persistent Cookies”.
We may use Persistent Cookies to remember your log-in details and make it easier for you to log-in the next time you access the Service. We may use cookies for additional purposes, to facilitate the use of the Service’s features and tools and to display personalized advertisements in your future navigation.
Our Service allows services who provide online advertising services (“Ad-Serving Providers”) to display to you and other users personalized content and advertisements on the Service and on other online sites and services.
The Ad-Serving Providers use their own cookies and other technologies, such as pixel tags to collect and use personal information for displaying personalized ads, by them and by additional providers, and to run, maintain, measure the effectiveness and develop their services.
A pixel tag (also known as “action tag” and “web beacon”) is a 1X1 pixels transparent object which is embedded in a web page to enable the display of optimized content and advertisements to end users.
The use of these technologies by these advertising services is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our Privacy Policy. We require our Ad-Serving Providers to include on the ads a link to information about their privacy practices and how to opt-out of their services. At any time, you may contact us at: info@themoney.expert and we will assist you in locating the Ad-Serving Providers’ privacy related information.
Every browser allows you to manage your cookies preferences. Please bear in mind that disabling cookies may complicate or even prevent you from using the Service.
