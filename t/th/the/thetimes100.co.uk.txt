2. Information on visitors
During the course of any visit to The Times 100, the pages you see are downloaded to your computer. If you choose to login and make use of our Member tools, a cookie will be set by The Times 100 & Facebook - Most, if not all, websites do this, because cookies allow the website publisher to do useful things like find out whether the computer (and probably its user) has visited the site before.
Cookies are completely optional on The Times 100 and unless you login using Facebook they will not be activated, they are used only to save you having to enter your information each time you wish to access/download certain areas of the site.
3. Use and storage of your personal information
When you supply any personal information to The Times 100 (e.g. for competitions, or to download certain files) we have legal obligations towards you in the way we deal with that data. We must collect the information fairly, that is, we must explain how we will use it (see the notices on particular pages that let you know why we are requesting the information). In general, any information you provide to The Times 100 will only be used within the The Times 100 and *MBA Publishing. It will never be supplied to anyone outside these organisations without first obtaining your consent, unless we are obliged or permitted by law to disclose it. Also, if you post or send offensive or inappropriate content anywhere on or to The Times 100 or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on The Times 100, and the The Times 100 considers such behaviour to be serious and/or repeated, The Times 100 can use whatever information that is available to it about you to stop such behaviour. This may include informing relevant third parties such as your employer, school or e-mail provider about the content and your behaviour.
We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you use the service you have requested, and remove it in the event that the purpose has been met, or, you no longer wish to continue your registration as a user. We will ensure that all personal information supplied is held securely, in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.
