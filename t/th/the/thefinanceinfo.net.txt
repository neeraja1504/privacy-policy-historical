Privacy Policy|News and Advice for Financial Decision - TheFinanceInfo.Net
Thefinanceinfo.net (" TheFinanceInfo ") operates TheFinanceInfo.net and may operate other websites. It is TheFinanceInfo's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, TheFinanceInfo collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. TheFinanceInfo's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how TheFinanceInfo's visitors use its website. From time to time, TheFinanceInfo may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
TheFinanceInfo also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on TheFinanceInfo.net blogs/sites. TheFinanceInfo only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to TheFinanceInfo's websites choose to interact with TheFinanceInfo in ways that require TheFinanceInfo to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that TheFinanceInfo gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at TheFinanceInfo.net to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with TheFinanceInfo are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, TheFinanceInfo collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with TheFinanceInfo. TheFinanceInfo does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
TheFinanceInfo may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. TheFinanceInfo may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, TheFinanceInfo does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
TheFinanceInfo discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on TheFinanceInfo's behalf or to provide services available at TheFinanceInfo's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using TheFinanceInfo's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. TheFinanceInfo will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, TheFinanceInfo discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when TheFinanceInfo believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of TheFinanceInfo, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an TheFinanceInfo website and have supplied your email address, TheFinanceInfo may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with TheFinanceInfo and our products. If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. TheFinanceInfo takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
