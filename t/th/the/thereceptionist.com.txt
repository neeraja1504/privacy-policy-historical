Updated: August 2016
This Privacy Policy explains the manner in which The Receptionist for iPad collects, uses, handles and discloses information about you that is collected in the course of your visit to our website, your access to and use of our products and services (“Service”) and your other interactions with us.
Personally Identifiable information
We do not collect any personally identifiable information about you when you visit our website unless you voluntarily disclose such information to us; such as when you register an account with us, fill out a form or elect to use certain features on our website. We do require basic contact information should you choose to order our Service, such as your and/or your company’s name, email address, mailing address and phone number. We also require payment information (such as a valid credit card number) for Service that is not free, but payment is handled by a third-party service provider and we do not process, store or otherwise take custody of or responsibility for this payment information. Ultimately, you have control over whether you visit our website anonymously, and you can always refuse to supply personally identifiable information, although doing so may restrict your access to certain features on our website as well as to our Service.
Our Service enables our customers to collect, store and manage data about themselves, their employees or their own customers and guests. For example, our customers may ask that visitors to their offices check in at a registration stand or desk using the Service by providing their name, address and other basic contact information, as well as their check-in and check-out times. These visitors may also be asked to take a picture and share additional information such as a date of birth or license plate number. The Service automatically creates a record of this information (e.g., a visitor log) that we collect and store for the limited purposes set forth below. Our customers are responsible for choosing what visitor data they wish to collect and for ensuring that their visitors consent to the collection of such data. For more information, please see our Terms of Service.
