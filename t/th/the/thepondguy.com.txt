When you visit our web site, we automatically recognize your Internet service provider, the Web page from which you came, and a record of your activity on our site. The customer information that The Pond Guy® collects through its web site is used to process orders and to improve your shopping experience.
We use the information you share with us to improve your shopping experience by allowing us to make our Web site easier and more enjoyable to use. The information you volunteer enables us to process your purchases, confirm your orders, customize the content and layout of our pages, notify you about updates to our site, and provide you with additional information about our products.
The information you supply to us is added to our customer database. We may also send you catalogs or emails to inform you of new products, services and special offers, special promotions or upcoming events for The Pond Guy®.
We may also share names, addresses and/or email addresses of our registered Web site guests with other contractors that The Pond Guy® may hire to assist us in making improvements to the site. The Pond Guy® requires that such companies keep all such information confidential and use it solely for the purpose of making improvements to the site.
We do occasionally share name and address information with other reputable organizations, such as catalog companies that offer similar products. We will not share any personal financial information. Nor will we share your email address.
If you supply us with your postal address on-line you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by sending an email to us or calling us or writing to us. Also you may receive mailings from other reputable companies.

We will be sure your name is removed from the list we share with other organizations.
We contract with a third-party service provider to place our advertising messages on other websites. This provider may collect anonymous information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process.
