In order to provide you with precise weather for the location in which you are located when you access the app and notifications about weather alerts in your location, provided location tracking is enabled. This data is generally not sufficient to identify you personally.
Location behaviour, if enabled, may be combined with postal codes (there are on average 20 houses per postal code so this does not generate a specific home address) and demographic data in the aggregate to deliver insights for third party marketing and content.
We may use your personal information in the following ways:

You do not have to provide any personal information to us. Use of our Services is purely voluntary. You can also continue to use our Services without consenting to the use of cookies that are not strictly necessary; the only consequence is that our Services will be less customized. For more information, please see our COOKIE POLICY.
You maintain control over the personal information you have provided to us. Users who have created an account with us can change their permissions at any time through management of their account.

Advertisers and advertising networks |
To select and serve relevant ads
We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 100 men aged under 35 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, mobile app users in a particular geographical location). This data does not constitute personal information because it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. However, it allows our advertisers to provide advertisements that may be more relevant to you.
Google Analytics |
To perform marketing analytics, website analytics, service and product analytics.
Marketing insights |
Your data may be used in the aggregate in providing analytics services such as store visit attribution and marketing insights for pelmorex customers and partners.

How Long We Keep Your Personal information
Your data is stored with Pelmorex for as long as we are required to keep it to provide our Services to you in a seamless fashion or in compliance with applicable law. For example, we will retain your data to facilitate logins to your account and to allow us to service your account for as long as you maintain an account with us. We also ensure we have up-to-date consent from you to continue to collect and store your personal information.
Safeguarding Your Personal information
We use a variety of technological, physical and organisational protections and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorised access, use, or disclosure, such as encryption, passwords and physical security measures.

Changes to this Policy
Policies on this site are constantly reviewed to ensure compliance with applicable laws. As such, this policy may be updated from time to time and any updates will be posted on this page.
ADVERTISING POLICY
Pelmorex Corp. doing business as “The Weather Network”, “MeteoMedia”, “El Tiempo” and “Clima” (collectively “we”, “us”, “our”) is committed to protecting and respecting the privacy of our users and safeguarding the personal information provided to us while accessing and using the Services we provide.
This Policy serves to provide our users with information on our collection and processing of their information to help our users better understand how we use it for advertising.
What We Do
As further detailed in our Privacy Policy Pelmorex collects certain information about our users as you use the Services we provide. The data does not include sensitive personal information but can include email addresses, name, computer IP address and location (if enabled) (for a more fulsome list see Personal Data We May Collect & Why We Need It in the Privacy Policy).
We use the personal information you provide for the some of the following processes:
customized weather information;
to provide you with weather alerts in the case of active weather in your location;
to measure or understand the effectiveness of advertising we serve and to deliver relevant advertising to you;
to enforce our Terms of Use, to the extent that your personal information is required to determine whether the Terms of Use have been violated;
to administer our Services.
What You Can Do
If you don’t want the personal information we collect used for targeted advertising, you have the following options to opt out:
The App:
When you download the app or when a new updated is pushed out you have the option of not consenting to location services. Location services function via the phone’s device ID. The app will continue to work without this consent and without location services enabled but you will need to input the location for which you want to see a local weather report each time you use the app and you will not receive localized weather alerts.
We may share anonymous device IDs with third parties for advertising, analytics, to ensure you receive a better consumer experience, in order to better understand our users in general and to guide our product improvements. You can limit the range of data that your phone sends to us by disabling the identifier on your mobile device. This will not affect how your device operates and you can find more information about how to do this from your phone manufacturer. If you opt not to share your location, you will continue to see advertising but it will be generic.
Pelmorex’ offers its Services to users for free and as such the compromise is the collection and use of personal information for, in part, targeted advertising. In the event that you would prefer that we not provide you with targeted advertising Pelmorex offers a paid app for iOS through the Apple Store which eliminates advertising entirely.
Bluetooth (Proximity Beacons):
Bluetooth beacons are devices that emit low-powered signals that have been set up in stores, museums, airports and other public spaces which can be detected by your mobile device when you enable Bluetooth and you utilize any app that you have downloaded and given permission to use your phone’s Bluetooth and location. When you grant permission in our app to enable location tracking we may collect data from physical proximity beacons located in or near public spaces where you are located at that point in time. If your device preferences allow our app access to location services, we may collect information about the location of your device in the store including data from each of our partners' beacons with which you interact. We may segment that data with other users and utilize it for content/advertising as well as share the segments with third parties. The information we collect does not identify you personally.
You may disable the communication of these beacons with your mobile device by disabling Bluetooth or modifying your preferences for location services for our app.
The Websites:
You have the option to set your browser to either accept cookies and/or Local Storage, to notify you before accepting cookies and/Local Storage, or to refuse cookies and/or Local Storage altogether. You can access cookie preferences in the “options” or “preferences” menu of your browser. Please see our Cookie Policy for further information on the cookies used on our sites.
Policies on this site are constantly reviewed to ensure compliance with applicable laws. As such, this policy may be updated from time to time and any updates will be posted on this page.
