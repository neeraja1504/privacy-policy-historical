Information Collection and Use
The Tech Museum of Innovation is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. The Tech collects information from our users at several different points on our website.
Registration
In order to use certain features of our website, a user may be required to first complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as age and gender), and unique identifiers (such as membership or promotional identification numbers), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.
Order
We request information from the user on our order forms. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.
Account Information and Email Usage
You can edit your museum account information including your email newsletter preferences at any time by visiting the My Account section of our website.
New categories of email newsletters might be added to the My Account preferences page from time to time. Users who visit this page can opt out of receiving future newsletters from these new categories or they can unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the messages they receive.
We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to The Tech, such as service announcements, administrative messages and our email newsletters, that are considered part of your account, while offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them by following instructions contained in the messages you receive.
Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers or co-branded content partnerships). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.
Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Sharing
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
