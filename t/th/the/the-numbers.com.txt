Information that we collect: ****
We collect only two kinds of information at The Numbers:  1) anonymous use information; and 2) information that you choose to give us through web forms when you register with The Numbers or choose to send e-mail to us.
1)  When you browse The Numbers site, read or download information such as box office charts, movie reviews or the movie release chart, we collect only the following limited, anonymous data:
Our servers may record the numerical Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you
are using, the operating system and browser you use, the date and time you access our
The Numbers site, and the Internet address of the web site from which you linked to The Numbers.
We use this information to diagnose system problems, to measure the number of visitors
we receive and where what pages on The Numbers site are most popular (but we never conduct “audit trails” that measure what pages individual users visit), and to improve the site. We may also use this information to block computers that are attempting denial of service attacks on The Numbers servers or for similar security purposes. ****
We may share this anonymous information with selected affiliates of The Numbers, but we will never disclose information that identifies you personally to anyone outside of The Numbers unless compelled by law (see below).
2)  The Numbers also invites visitors to register via our online forms. You will need to register if you would like to participate in our forums, polls or contests, submit reviews or receive our monthly e-mail newsletter.
The only information you must provide if you choose to register is your e-mail address. We use this information for verification purposes; also, if you sign up for our monthly newsletter (see below), then we will send the newsletter to the e-mail address you give us here. We will not disclose your e-mail address to anyone else unless compelled by law (see below). ****
You may choose to let use place a cookie on your PC if you would like to log on to The Numbers automatically. We will use the cookie only to log you on, and for no other purpose. ****
You may choose to give us basic anonymous demographic information (the city, state and country in which you live, your zip code, and your age group). We may use this information to provide you and other site users with analysis of the most popular movies in various age groups or areas, to provide movie listings in your zip code, etc. We may also share this general demographic information with selected affiliates of The Numbers, but again, we will never sell or otherwise disclose personally identifiable information about you unless we are compelled by law (see below). Providing us with this general demographic information is entirely optional—just leave the fields blank if you do not want to share it with us.
If you would like to sign up for a contest or prize or to become a contributor to the site, we will need your mailing address.  We will use your mailing address to send you any prizes or necessary correspondence.  We will not sell or otherwise disclose your mailing address or password to anyone else unless we are compelled by law (see below). If you sign up for a contest or prize, however, we may use your name and your home state in a list of winners on the site. Please read the official rules for any contest.
