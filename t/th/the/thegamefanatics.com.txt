Privacy Policy & Disclosure - The Game Fanatics
The Game Fanatics strives to bring you the best in independent video game journalism. We are not perfect, do not claim to be perfect, and probably will never be perfect, but we do believe that perfection is something to strive for, no matter how futile our attempts may be. The articles within, though a part of The Game Fanatics, are the expressed opinions of the individual writers. All images displayed are property of their respective owners. Most of the items and games we review are sent to us to be reviewed. We do get paid to promote certain products or services. The Game Fanatics is not owned by any company or agency, and at no time can anyone not listed on the Staff page represent The Game Fanatics.
The Game Fanatics may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

As of December 1, 2009, the FTC requires bloggers to provide disclosures whenever there could be hidden interests or unspoken biases related to recommendations. To save ourselves the stress of having to staple a disclaimer to each review and post we write, please assume that, for every recommendation, link, and products that we review, the following all hold true:
-The above disclosure, though edited, is borrowed from The Gadgeteer.
We believe in being honest, trustworthy, and accurate. We tell it like it is, because we are gamers ourselves.
