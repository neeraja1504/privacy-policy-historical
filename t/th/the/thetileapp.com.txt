Privacy Policy - Tile
Effective Date: December 18, 2018
Tile is designed to make life easier and less stressful. This policy describes what information we collect from you and how we use it to accomplish that mission.
We take your privacy as seriously as you do, and because of that we take great care to collect only the information necessary to provide you with the best possible Tile experience.
As you review our policy, keep in mind that it applies to Tile Inc.’s (“Tile”, “We”, “Us”) website, mobile app, help center, and all other associated services that we provide (“Services”).
1. Information Tile Collects
In this Privacy Policy, the term "Personal Information" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to a name, an identification number, or, in certain circumstances, Location Information, an IP address or the unique identifier allocated to each Tile device. Specifically, we collect the following information from you, which may include Personal Information.
A. Placing an order
i. Contact Information
When you place an order on our website, you’ll need to provide an email address, a first and last name, and a shipping address.  In some cases, we may also require your phone number.
ii. Payment Information
In order to complete your order on our website, you’ll need to provide payment information, such as your credit card or PayPal account. This information is needed in order to process your order and is not stored on our servers.
B. Registering for the mobile app
You’ll need to use a valid email address and create a password to create an account for Services on the Tile app. You can choose whether or not you’d like to provide your first and last name.
We do not identify you personally to other users or make your account information available to any third parties in any way that could identify you without your prior consent.
C. Connecting with Social Networks
When you create a Tile account, you may choose to connect and interact with a third-party social networking service (“Social Network”). If you decide to interact with a Social Network when using our Services, we are permitted to collect Personal Information that you have already made public on your Social Network account. You can manage this information in the privacy settings of each Social Network.
D. Information from Your Use of the Services
i. Tile ID, Name, and Photograph
When you activate a Tile using the Tile app, that Tile’s unique identifier (or Tile ID) will be associated with your account. If you choose to name your Tile or add a photo of it, this information will also be associated with your account.
ii. Location Information
Tile is designed to tell you where your items are. In order to do that, it’s necessary to collect data about your location. We use the term “Location Information” to refer to the combined location data of your phone or device, and your Tiles.
While the app is running on your device, it periodically transmits your Location Information. This allows us to show you, on your map, the last place your Tile was seen by your device (“Last Place Seen”). It is one of the primary ways Tile helps you find your lost items.
Tile normally only records the latest Location Information update for each of your Tiles, to provide the Last Place Seen.  For Tile Premium users, Location Information for each Tile is stored for up to 30 days, to support the Location History feature.  In both cases, Tile does this so you can find the most recent Location Information for your Tiles, in case you lose them.
Location Information is archived in a way that cannot be associated with you using a process called pseudonymization, where data will be untraceable to a specific Tile user.  Tile keeps this archival data so we can answer general questions unrelated to any person, such as “How many Tiles were in London in 2016 versus 2017?”
We may also collect and update Location Information for your Tile(s) anonymously from other Tile users who are running the Tile app or from other third parties that are using an app or device that has integrated the Tile functionality (each, a “Tile Finder”) within Bluetooth range of your device. We do this to provide you with the most recent and accurate location of your Tiles, even if they are out of your devices’ Bluetooth range. These updates are fundamental to the Tile Community, which allows Tile Finders to help either other find their lost Tiles.  The Location Information is reported anonymously and does not identify the owner of a Tile to others.
If you use a computer, phone, or other device to visit our website or help center, we use the IP address of that computer or device to determine an approximate location. We do this so that we can provide you with a better, more personal customer service experience.
We use your Location Information to provide the Services and may use your Location Information to promote the Services or provide you with offers. However, your Location Information is never shared with other users unless you choose to share it through our Services.
iii. Mobile Application Usage Information
We track how, and how often you use our Services. We also collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use them for Services. This includes information such as your device’s model, operating system type and version, and the dates and times of your requests. We use this information to provide you with optimal services and support, and to collect anonymous statistics that help us understand our user base.
E. Information Collected Through Tile’s Support Services
We provide support services via live chat on our website, email request submissions, recorded outbound telephone calls and direct email. We collect any Personal Information you may choose to provide to our customer care team in the process. This includes, but is not limited to: your name, email address, phone number, and mailing address. We may use and process your Personal Information, including Location Information, to handle your support request and provide you with the best support possible.
F. Human Resources Data
Tile collects Personal Information from current, prospective, and former Employees, their contact points in case of a medical emergency, and beneficiaries under any insurance policy (“Human Resources Data”). The Human Resources Data we collect may include title, name, address, phone number, email address, date of birth, passport number, driver’s license number, Social Security number or other government-issued identification number, financial information related to credit checks, bank details for payroll, information that may be recorded on a CV or application form, language abilities, contact information of third parties in case of an emergency and beneficiaries under any insurance policy. We may also collect Sensitive Human Resources Data such as details of health and disability, including mental health, medical leave, and maternity leave; information about national origin or immigration status; and optional demographic information such as race, which helps us achieve our diversity goals.
We acquire, hold, use and Process Human Resources Data for a variety of business purposes including: workflow management, including assigning, managing and administering projects; human Resources administration and communication; payroll and the provision of benefits; compensation, including bonuses and long-term incentive administration, stock plan administration, compensation analysis, including monitoring overtime and compliance with labor laws, and company recognition programs; job grading activities; performance and employee development management; organizational development and succession planning; benefits and personnel administration; absence management; helpdesk and IT support services; regulatory compliance; internal and/or external or governmental compliance investigations; internal or external audits; litigation evaluation, prosecution, and defense; diversity and inclusion initiatives; restructuring and relocation; emergency contacts and services; employee safety; compliance with statutory requirements; processing of employee expenses and travel charges; and acquisitions, divestitures, and integrations.
G. Information from Other Sources
We may receive information about you from other sources, including through third-party services and organizations to supplement information provided by you. For example, if you access our Services through a third-party application, such as an App Store or Social Network, we may collect information about you from that third-party application that you have made public via your privacy settings. Information we collect through App Stores or Social Network accounts may include your name, your Social Network user identification number, your Social Network user name, location, sex, birth date, email, profile picture, and your contacts on the Social Network. This supplemental information allows us to verify information that you have provided to Tile and to enhance our ability to provide you with information about our business, products, and Services.
2. Cookies and Other Web Technologies
A. Cookies
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer’s hard drive or onto your mobile device’s memory -- if your browser is set to accept cookies. Like many other online services, cookies and other tools like them help us collect and understand how you use our services.
Although most internet browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your settings or use third-party tools to prompt you before accepting cookies from the websites you choose to visit, or to refuse cookies altogether. You can even delete them through your browser. Most browsers also have settings to prevent them from accepting new cookies, to notify you when you receive a new cookie, or to delete or disable cookies altogether. Some parts of our Services may not work for you if you disable cookies.
B. How We Use Cookies
We use cookie technology in various ways to help make it easier for you to use our Services. For example, we use cookies to remember you when you return to our website, identify you when you sign-in, authenticate your access, keep track of your in-app specified preferences or choices, tailor content to you or geographic region, display a personalized browsing history, and/or to provide specific technical support.
We may also use cookies to gauge site usage, conduct research and diagnostics to improve the content we provide you, our products and services, and to help us analyze general web traffic.
The cookies we use expire after they have fulfilled their purpose. Some cookies expire when you close your browser (i.e., session cookies) or after a set period of time (i.e., persistent cookies). The expiration time of cookies that are placed by third parties (explained below) is determined by the third-party, not us.
C. Web Beacons
Web beacons (also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).
D. Do Not Track
While our website and the Tile app at this time do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, such as "do not track" instructions, you can generally express your privacy preferences regarding the use of most cookies and similar technologies through your web browser, as indicated above.
3. Collection of Your Personal Information by Third-Party Services
Sometimes Tile uses third-party service providers. These third-party service providers may place cookies on your computer's hard drive or your mobile device's memory or use web beacons to collect or receive information from the Services and elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide analytics and to target ads. The information practices of these outside services are not covered by this Privacy Policy. We cannot access, nor do we have any control over, the cookies or other web technologies they may use.
A. Web Analysis Services
We may use third-party web analysis services which use cookies or other web technologies to collect usage information, matched to an IP address, to help us analyze how our users use our website and some portions of the Tile app.  We collect this information in order to improve overall experience of our Services for our users.
We utilize Google Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc. to gather information about how users and visitors engage with our Site and Services. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit
B. How We Disclose Your Personal Information
Like other companies, we may disclose your information to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe is necessary to (i) comply with a law, regulation, or legal request; (ii) protect the safety of any person; (iii) address potential violations of our Privacy Policy or terms of service; (iv) investigate fraud, security, or technical issues; or (v) protect Tile’s rights or property, our employees, users and the public.
In addition, if we are acquired by a third-party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third-party, in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets - including any information collected from or about you - may be disclosed or transferred to a third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.
4. We Are Not Responsible for Content on Third Party Websites
Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third parties (each, a “Third-party Service”). Any information that you provide on or to a Third-party Service, or that is collected by a Third-party Service, is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third-party Service and is subject to the owner’s or operator’s privacy policy. We’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of any Third-party Service. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third-party Services that you access.

All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us better serve individuals by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products and services we provide. The survey responses may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of our Services, various types of communications, advertising campaigns, and/or promotional activities.

We may share this information within Tile and with third parties for our or their purposes in an anonymized or aggregated form that is designed to prevent anyone from identifying you.

Tile’s Services may offer various tools and functionalities. For example, Tile allows you to provide information about your friends through our referral services, such as “Refer a Friend.” Our referral services may allow you to forward or share certain content with a friend or colleague, such as an email inviting your friend to use our Services. Email addresses that you may provide for a friend or colleague will be used to send your friend or colleague the content or link you request, but will not be collected or otherwise used by Tile or any other third parties for any other purpose.
