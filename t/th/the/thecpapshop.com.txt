Agile encourages Users not to post sensitive personal information in such forums, discussions or other areas. Such information will be accessible to other Users and individuals. Agile and its subsidiaries are not responsible for the information you volunteer about yourself in discussions on our forums or other publicly accessible interactions, or the information that you choose to provide to exhibitors during in-person events.

We use cookies (small data files stored on your computer by your web browser upon visiting a website), web beacons, and similar technologies to operate our services efficiently and as intended. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store unique identifiers, user preferences and other information. Through such technologies, we gather information about you, such as your browser type, operating system, IP address, mobile device identification number, the sites visited before and after our Site, and about your interactions with our services, such as the time and date when you viewed a page, location of visit, browsing actions, and whether you filled out an online form.
Web beacons are small electronic files (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, or single-pixel gifs) to permit Agile to count users who have visited pages or interacted with marketing communications.
You may set your browser to block all cookies, including Agile and its subsidiaries while using our services, but doing so will prevent some aspects of our services to not function properly. You may also set your browser to block third-party cookies and allow first-party cookies, which would allow us (but not third parties) to collect such information while you are on our sites.

We may collect information from third party social networks. This allows for the sharing of contacts and content between Company and a third-party social network and “liking” or “sharing” Company content. Information that you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Service or by the third-party service you use. Similarly, if you post information on a third-party service that references Agile or its subsidiaries (ie, hashtag), your post may be used on or in connection with the Company. Both Company and third party may have access to certain information about you or your use of the Service and any Third-Party Service.
The Company may use Google Analytics, Tealium, and other third-party providers for analytics services. Information generated by these services may be transmitted to and stored by these service providers on servers in the United States (or elsewhere) and these service providers may use this information for purposes of evaluating your use of the Service, compiling statistical reports on the Services’ activity, and providing other services related to the Services activity and Internet usage.
H OW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
We may use your information for the following purposes:
To provide the Services to you and improve the Services;
To operate, improve, and personalize the products and services we offer and to give each user a more consistent and personalized experience when interacting with us;
To provide you with information and promotions on products and services that we think might be of interest to you;
For customer service, security, to detect fraud or illegal activities, and for archival and back-up purposes in connection with the provision of the Services;
To send you account notices, including registration confirmation, and to provide you with information about products or Services you have ordered, or which may be of interest to you;
For research and analysis purposes;
To communicate with users; and
To enforce our Terms of Use and other applicable policies.
We may also use your Personal Information to ask for input about our services, events, or products or provide you with additional information about the sites.
We may also, consistent with applicable law, send you e-newsletters with targeted, relevant content. Each e-newsletter will provide you with an opportunity to unsubscribe. Unsubscribing from one newsletter will may affect delivery of other newsletters or services.
In some cases, consistent with applicable law, we may send you relevant offers from third party businesses or organizations. Many of our customers appreciate receiving these offers because they relate to their personal needs. However, you will always be able to opt-out of receiving future third party offers. All promotional and research email messages you receive from us will include an option to opt-out of future email communications from that particular Agile subsidiary or brand.
At times, the Company may engage and work with Service Providers to serve advertisements on the Services or products. These ads may be tailored to your preferences based on browsing history or online behavior, sometimes referred to as “internet-based advertising.” This may include sending you an ad on a third-party service after you have left Services.
HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES
Generally, we do not sell or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.
We may provide your information to our clients as well as those acting as our agents in providing our products and services, including third-party companies we have employed to provide us with specialized services, including customer service, research, statistical analysis, information verification, postal mailings, and other information services. In compliance with privacy laws, we also provide our opt-out lists to those third-party companies so that they can be suppressed from the communications those companies send on Agile’ companies behalf.
From time to time our partners may wish to receive information detailing User engagement with content, or contact our subscribers and customers who may have indicated an interest in the products, services or events for which the partner is associated. If you register for products or services offered by such partners, or for events sponsored in whole or in part by a third party, or otherwise opt-in to permit us to share your personally identifiable information, then you may receive communications, consistent with applicable law, directly from such third parties. If you provide information on a co-branded site or while using a co-branded service, you grant us permission to share the information you have provided with that service or site partner. Their use of your information is subject to their privacy policies and we urge you to read those policies and be aware of their privacy practices before registering.
Should you attend one of our sponsored events, we may provide the Personal Information you provide to us to vendors also attending the event. We will only provide this information to the vendor for a specific use and purpose, but do not warrant that the vendor will keep the same information confidential or private. In addition, we may share your contact information with sponsors who appear in a particular e-newsletter of ours if you click on their link in the e-newsletter, and they may, consistent with applicable law, contact you regarding their products and services.
The Company may share information about you for any purposes not inconsistent with the Privacy Policy including:
To contracted third parties to help with our business operations, such as investigation of fraud or bill collection;
If you signed up for the newsletter or participated in a survey involving a third party contractor that performs such services on our behalf;
To comply with the law, law enforcement or other legal processes, or in response to a government request;
If the Company believes your actions are inconsistent with applicable terms or policies or to protect the rights, property, life, health, security, and safety of Company, Services, users, or any third party;
To fulfill the purpose you provided;
With you consent.
In addition, the Company may share information (personal and non-personal) in connection with or during negotiations of any proposed or actual financing of our business, or merger, purchase, sale, joint venture, or any other type of acquisition or business combination of any or all portion of Company assets, or transfer of all or a portion of Company’s business to another company, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceedings.
To the extent we receive your protected healthcare information in our capacity as a covered entity under applicable state or federal healthcare privacy laws, our Notice of Protected Health Information Privacy Policy will govern practices with respect to such information in those circumstances.
