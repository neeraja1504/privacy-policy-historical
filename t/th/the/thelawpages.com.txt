Legal basis for processing
The Legal basis for processing is our legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation), the wider public interest on the principles of Open Justice and the administration of justice (Criminal Proceedure Rules).
TheLawPages.Com serve legal professionals, the media and the public under the principles of Open Justice. We provide a professionals directory, Crown and High Court Lists and a Criminal Sentences Tool.
Court Lists
TheLawPages publishes 'Court lists' which gives the date, court name, case number and defendants name. For a full court list journalists should contact the court to obtain information including the defendants date of birth, current address and details of the charges against them. This information is disclosed to journalists to ensure the accurate identification of a defendant (even where it is not presented in open court).
Users of TheLawPages.Com have a legitimate interest which justifies the continued availability of court list data (See Criminal Procedure Rules). The court list data is placed on a public notice board and open to public inspection. Court hearings may be listed over several years. The court list data on TheLawPages.Com can be browsed for the previous 6 months and searched for a year. We do not allow search engines to serve cached version of the court lists.
There is a reasonable expectation that the defendants name would appear on the court lists. The information is factual and defendants are innocent until proven guilty.
Archives of the court lists, including indictments (where resporting restictions do not apply), may be available on The National Archives - http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/criminal-courts-england-wales-from-1972/ - and on other websites (including courtserve.net) which are not controlled by us.
Sentences Tool
We provide some court case results - information linking criminal offences, defendants, barristers, solicitors and judges - to further Open Justice - 'Justice Seen, Justice Done'.
Right to be forgotton
We anonymise data when a sentence is spent (The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974).
We consider all requests for removal, especially where an individual might be identified due to an unusual name and there are concerns there is a negative effect on that individual or it would cause them unwarranted harm.
Children and sensitive personal information
There are automatic reporting restrictions on the names of minors and we do not collect sensitive personal information.
