Disclosure to service providers. Chevron contracts with other companies to provide services on our behalf, such as hosting websites, sending out information, processing transactions, and analyzing our websites. We provide these companies with only those elements of your personal data they need to deliver those services. These companies and their employees are prohibited from using those personal data for any other purposes.
Disclosure in connection with transactions. In connection with certain transactions, we may disclose some or all of your personal data to financial institutions, government entities, and shipping companies or postal services involved in fulfilling the transaction.
Disclosures in connection with acquisitions or divestitures. Circumstances may arise where for strategic or other business reasons Chevron decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize particular businesses. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal data to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers. It is Chevron's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.

For sites to which you login, it is your responsibility to ensure the security of your password and not to reveal this information to others. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always logout before leaving a website so that subsequent users will not be able to access your data.
