Welcome to The Great Courses Daily and to thegreatcoursesdaily.com Website (“Website”).   The Teaching Company Sales, LLC d/b/a The Great Courses (“The Great Courses”), its subsidiaries and affiliates, or other members of our family of companies value your participation and loyalty. We are committed to the protection of subscriber, customer and community privacy. The Great Courses has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate its commitment to the privacy and protection of your personal information. To better protect your privacy, The Great Courses provides this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used in connection with our The Great Courses Daily Website.
Information about Us
The Great Courses Daily Website is operated by The Teaching Company Sales, LLC, 4840 Westfields Blvd., Suite 500, Chantilly, VA 20151-2299 (under the trading name of “The Great Courses”). If you would like information on how to contact us, click Contact Us.
What Information Is Collected
The following are the types of information we may collect:
The Great Courses may collect personal information, which shall include but is not limited to, name, telephone number, email address, date of birth, and home or business mailing address, as well as cookies associated with your visits to the Website and other information when you access the Website.
At other times, The Great Courses may collect information that cannot or might not be used to directly identify you, such as browser type, Dynamic Internet Protocol (IP) address, cookie-enabled data, “click stream” data, and similar non-personally identifiable information.  For example, we may aggregate non-personal information about you and other visitors who visit certain areas of our Website. Aggregated information will not contain any information that can be linked directly back to you.
While we take all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of our Website visitors, we cannot promise that the current limitations of our online applications programming will address every browser setting or honor every personal browser preference. In particular, we have not implemented the necessary program changes to honor “Do Not Track” or “DNT” browser signals. As our online applications programming is refined, we will take all reasonable steps to honor such requests in the future. Please return to this Privacy Policy for further updates on this topic.
Further, our online service providers or business partners and vendors, as well as those third party websites which visitors can link to from our Website, may implement technologies that allow for the collection of personally identifiable information over time and across Websites. We recommend that you review each privacy policy posted on the Websites that you visit to better understand privacy practices on those Websites.

When you open emails from us or engage in other communication with us, we may log and store such information.

4. **Shared Information**
We may share your personal information with our Internet Service Providers as appropriate.  We may also share personally identifiable information with outside, non-affiliated third parties that offer products and services that are complementary to our products and services.

We use third-party ad serving, analytics, and audience and traffic measurement services.   We may use a third-party network advertiser to serve the advertisements on the Website or may use a traffic measurement service to analyze the traffic on the Website or the use of our Services. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to this Website and other Websites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products or Websites you might be interested in.  Audience and traffic measurement services allow us to collect anonymous traffic and behavior information from the Website by monitoring anonymous visitor activity. Other companies’ uses of their cookies are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp in order to learn more about the information collection practices and “opt-out” procedures of third-party ad servers we may use.
