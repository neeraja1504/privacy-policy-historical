Our Services
Signal is a service provider. We license proprietary technology and provide data solutions to our clients (the technology and services together, the “ Services ”).
Our services include:
Integration of tracking tags and other code into client websites, mobile applications and other devices that allows clients and their various third-party marketing and technology partners to collect data relating to user interactions and interests;
Collection and distribution of data for the purposes of measuring the effectiveness of websites, mobile applications, advertising campaigns and interactions with other marketing channels;
Management and storage of de-identified data that allows our clients to recognize their customers across devices and platforms, to better understand their customers and to engage their customers with more targeted marketing messages.
Data Signal Collects or Receives and Stores in Connection with the Services
Signal does not have any relationship, contractual or otherwise, with visitors to its clients’ Data Sources. In order to provide the Services to our clients, we collect data from our clients’ websites, mobile applications, advertising impressions, email campaigns, retail stores and other sources (collectively “ Data Sources ”).
The information we collect or that clients provide us about their customers we call “ Client Data “. “ Personal Information ” means information that identifies the user of a Data Source as a specific individual, such as the user’s name, mailing address, email address, or phone number or other information that identifies you as an actual person.
Client Data collected or provided in connection with certain Services (such as analytics), may include Personal Information but we do not use Personal Information in connection with any Services that assist clients with their interest-based advertising. Note that in providing the Services, we do not collect any Personal Information on our own behalf – we collect information on behalf of our clients as service provider to those clients. We only store, use and share Personal Information collected through our Services as directed by our clients on their behalf.
We do not use Personal Information in connection with advertising-related Services. For advertising related Services, we do use and store data that has been de-identified, which is typically accomplished using a mathematical process (commonly known as a hash function) to convert information into a code that we cannot use to identify you directly. We combine this information with other de-identified information collected from or provided by other client Data Sources in order to help our clients recognize their customers and infer customer interests and preferences.
In order to provide the Services to our clients, we automatically collect certain information about your use of our client’s Data Sources when you visit or interact with those Data Sources (“ Usage Data ”). We collect a variety of Usage Data including, for example:
IP address and other unique identifier for any computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access the client’s Data Sources (“ device identifier ”);
Information about a visitor’s Web browser and device;
Information about visitor interactions with the client’s Data Source, such as content viewed and products purchased;
Information regarding a user’s preferences and interests;
Demographic data, such as age and gender; and
Location information.
We consider the following “Sensitive Data,” and we do not use this Sensitive Data in connection with interest-based advertising Services:
racial or ethnic origin;
sexual preferences or practices;
criminal record;
health information;
genetic information that is not otherwise health information; or
biometric information or templates.
We further limit the collection and use of sensitive data as defined and required by applicable law in certain jurisdictions. For example, some jurisdictions define sensitive data to further include:
political opinions;
membership of a political association;
religious beliefs or affiliations;
philosophical beliefs;
membership of a professional or trade association;
membership of a trade union.
We may also supplement Client Data with outside records from third parties, and we treat the combined data as described in this Services Privacy Policy.
Technologies Used to Collect Usage Data.
We use many technologies to collect Usage Data. Some examples include:
Cookies and Local Storage. Cookies and local storage are data files placed within a browser on a device when it is used to visit a Data Source. Cookies and local storage can both be used to store a unique identifier for your device that can be used to recognize your device whenever you visit a client Data Source. Most browsers provide you with the ability to disable or decline cookies and local storage. You will need to check your browser’s settings for further information.
Web Beacons. Web Beacons are small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) that are included in our clients’ Data Sources.
Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with a Data Source. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server, is active only while you are connected to the Data Source, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
SDKs and APIs. SDKS and APIs are programming codes that collect information about your interactions with a Data Source. This code is installed on a Device, typically within our clients’ applications that you choose to download onto your mobile device.
These technologies, and similar technologies we may use, and the information they collect may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, tracking your visits to Data Sources, monitoring how you navigate a Data Source and determining your preferences and interests for the purposes of serving you targeted advertisements and other marketing messages.
Signal may receive Client Data through certain technology or services that clients license through affiliated services, including those offered by Signal Digital, Inc., if the client utilizes the services of both companies. We use all information we collect and receive in accordance with this policy.
The Purposes for which We Collect, Hold, and Use Information
We collect, hold and use de-identified information from clients to provide the Services, including to infer your interests and preferences and to allow our clients and others to target advertisements and offers to you based on those interests and preferences. Apart from the above instances, we may also collect, hold, and use information collected or received in connection with the Services to provide the Services, to improve the Services, for our internal business purposes and to meet any legal requirements or needs. Click opt out tool for information on how you may opt-out of having information we collect or infer about you or your device for targeted advertising purposes.
Disclosure of Information to Third Parties
Non-identifying data. We may share non-identifying data, including aggregate statistics and hashed or otherwise de-identified data, with third parties.
Client Data. We may transfer Client Data and inferences about that Client Data to the client or to a third party (including, without limitation, advertising networks) at the client’s direction. We may share inferred interests and preferences and other Client Data with multiple clients and advertising networks and this information may be connected to your IP address, device identifier, or other information that our client has collected from you (including hashed Personal Information).
Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf or on Behalf of Our Clients. Third parties who provide services to us may have access to information, including Personal Information, in order to perform services for us or on behalf of our clients.
Administrative and Legal Reasons. We may transfer and disclose information, including Client Data, to third parties: (i) to respond to subpoenas or other legal processes or if in our opinion the disclosure is required by law; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; or (iii) to respond to an emergency or otherwise to protect the safety, rights, property or security of any person or entity.
Business Transfers. We may disclose and transfer Client Data: (a) if we assign our rights regarding any of the information to a third party or (b) in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, sale of certain of Signal and/or its parent company ownership interests, assets, or both, bankruptcy or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process.
For other purposes. We may transfer and disclose Client Data to other third parties as otherwise required by law.
Your Privacy Choices
We understand that you may wish to opt-out of our use of information about you or your devices to provide targeted advertising services to our clients. Please note that the opt-out choices below apply only with regard to our use of information associated with your devices for interest-based advertising purposes. Please note that it may take up to 7 days to process your opt-out request.
Signal is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to the NAI code of conduct. You may use the NAI opt out tool, which will allow you to opt out of seeing targeted ads through your web browser from NAI member companies. We also support the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA).

If you delete our opt-out cookie(s), we will not be able to ensure that your information is no longer used to provide our Services, unless you return to this page and opt-out again.

For mobile apps, you can typically limit ad tracking using the settings on your phone, tablet or other mobile device using the “Ads” menu, “Ad Tracking” setting, or similar setting on your device.
Please be aware that opting out does not mean that you will no longer receive targeted marketing messages in your mobile apps or Web browsers. You may still receive generic advertisements and you may see targeted advertisements based on information collected and used by entities other than Audience Trust.
How We Respond To Do Not Track Signals
Your web browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit.  Like many websites and online services, Signal does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
Data Retention
We retain client data as long as it is active, which we consider to be up to one year from the date of the last update made by the client.  Therefore, if a client uploads a customer record and makes no changes to that record, then it will automatically be deleted from our system after one year. Every time a client updates the customer record, then the one year counter begins again.  We also retain data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Security
We take commercially reasonable steps to help protect and secure Client Data (including against unauthorized access, modification and disclosure, and from other types of misuse, interference and loss). However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless connection, or electronic storage of data, can be guaranteed to be completely secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information we collect or store.
Changes to this Policy
We may change this policy from time to time, and any changes will be effective as soon as we post the revised policy on this Website, unless a different date is stated. You should review this policy regularly.
