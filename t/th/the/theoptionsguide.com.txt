Links to a third party site
Our web site provides links to other web sites. Please be aware that when you click on one of these links, you are going to another web site even though the TheOptionsGuide.com logo or banner may still be visible. Information you enter on these other web sites is being collected by that site, not TheOptionsGuide.com. Please read the privacy statements of these linked sites as their Privacy Policy Statement may differ from ours.

Is my Personal information Secure?

Even with these security measures, we cannot guarantee that your communications with our site will never be unlawfully intercepted, or that your personal information will never be unlawfully accessed by third parties. Your password should never be shared with anyone. TheOptionsGuide.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited telephone call or e-mail. We will continue to assess new technology to evaluate its ability to provide additional protection of your personal information.
