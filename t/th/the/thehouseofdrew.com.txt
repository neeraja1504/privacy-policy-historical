There are two types of Information that may be collected through our Website: (1) "Personal Information" which is information that can be used to directly identify you such as your name, e-mail address, physical address, phone number, and credit card number, and (2) "Usage Data" which is anonymous information not linked to you personally that is related to your use of the Website, including information about the computer and mobile device you use when visiting the Website, (e.g., your unique device ID, Internet Protocol (IP) address, or other persistent identifiers), as well as data regarding your activity, such as the actions you take within and outside of the Website, the browser and/or device you use, and the date and time of your use of the Website.
You may enter the Website and browse its contents without submitting any Personal Information. However, if you wish to establish an account, make a purchase, contact us, subscribe to our newsletter or other mailings, post any comments, participate in certain promotions, or otherwise communicate with us, whether through our Website, our social media pages or any of our e-mail addresses, we may at that time require that you provide Personal Information or give you the ability to provide Personal Information. When you submit Personal Information in any manner, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
If you choose to connect to our Website through a third-party social network such as Facebook (each, a "Social Network"), we may collect Personal Information from your profile on such Social Network, such as your name, username, and e-mail address, and we may publish your activity on our Website through such Social Network.

Uses and Sharing of Information
We use the Personal Information that we collect to process your requests, fulfill your orders, authenticate website visits/usage, inform you of relevant products and specials through promotional e-mails, maintain and develop our Website, and otherwise communicate with you.

In addition, aggregated, non-personally-identifiable Usage Data may be used by us, or shared with our Service Providers for use, in connection with general operational, administrative, advertising, analytical, research, optimization, and security purposes, but no such information will be linked with your Personal Information or be used to identify or contact you.

As part of our collection and use of Usage Data (as described in more detail herein), we, or our Service Providers, may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, or similar tracking technologies. These "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Generally, Cookies work by assigning to your computer a unique number that has no meaning outside of the Website but can be used to gather Usage Data. While Cookies may record certain persistent identifiers related to your computer or device, they do not contain any Personal Information.
Most web browsers automatically accept Cookies, but you can usually configure your browser to prevent this. However, not accepting Cookies may make certain features of the Website unavailable to you.
Targeted Advertising
We engage certain third party ad network Service Providers to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services. These entities may utilize Cookies (including within the ads) to collect Usage Data from you such as your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, how you use our Website, items you put in your basket, any links you click on, and conversion information. This information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content or products, measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns, determine the proper amount of repeat views of a given ad, and deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our websites and other websites (also known as "interest-based advertising").

This website is targeted to adults. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information directly from anyone under the age of 13.

However, the foregoing does not apply to businesses like ours that do not disclose Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes without prior approval or give customers a free mechanism to opt out of having their personal information disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. California users may request further information about their rights under this law and our policy by writing to us, using the subject line "CA Request for Information," and requesting further information.
