Do we use P3P technology?
Thrivent Financial uses P3P technology. P3P (Platform for Privacy Preferences) allows you to monitor and control the way your personal information is used on Web sites. If you have a P3P-enabled browser, you can set specific privacy criteria that you are comfortable with. Then, when you visit a Web site that has summarized their privacy practices for P3P, your browser will evaluate the site to see if it meets your criteria. Sites not matching your criteria will result in the browser displaying a warning notice or blocking transmission to the site.

Do we use encryption technology?
Several areas on Thrivent Financial's Web site (e.g., My Accounts) have been built to handle sensitive or confidential information. These pages utilize an Internet method known as Secure Socket Layers (SSL). With SSL engaged, pages are sent to you in an encrypted (scrambled) format and any information you submit to Thrivent Financial also is encrypted. Encryption is the transformation of data into a form unreadable by anyone who doesn't have the appropriate decryption key. This method of transferring sensitive data is considered the industry standard for the Internet.
For added security, close your browser completely when you finish using this site. While online, your browser is using part of your computer's memory. If your broswer is left open, it may be possible for someone using your computer to go back and use this memory to access your information. Closing your browser, clears this memory. You may also want to consider clearing your browser's temporary files.
For your security, we highly recommend you update your browser to versions that support SSL. Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari are three browsers that support these encryption techniques. A solid lock graphic will display when the SSL mode is engaged and the connection is encrypted. If you are not sure if your browser is compatible, check with your service provider.
Thrivent Financial has taken steps to make all information you provide to us as secure as possible against unauthorized access and use, alteration, and/or loss. This information is kept in Thrivent Financial's secure database. You should keep in mind, however, that no data transmission over the Internet is 100 percent secure and any information disclosed online can potentially be intercepted and used by unauthorized parties.
