Website Visitors
Like most website operators, threewords.me collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. threewords.me's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how threewords.me's visitors use threewords.me. From time to time, threewords.me may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
threewords.me also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. threewords.me does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to threewords.me choose to interact with threewords.me in ways that require threewords.me to gather personally-identifying information.

In each case, threewords.me collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with threewords.me. threewords.me does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, threewords.me discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when threewords.me believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of threewords.me, third parties or the public at large.
