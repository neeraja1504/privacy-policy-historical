COOKIES
Solo uses cookies – small files containing a string of characters.
We use cookies to improve the quality and usability of our service.
Most of the cookies used by Solo are so-called session cookies:
they will be deleted after your session automatically. Solo also
uses cookies to identify a user during a session, so the user does
not have to log in on any personalized site again and again.
You can force your browser to block cookies in your browser

not be usable anymore.
