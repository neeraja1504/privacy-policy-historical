PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT WE MAY COLLECT FROM YOU
Our Services may attempt to collect information through a number of different methods. In many cases we collect information that you provide directly when interacting with our Services. When using our Services you may be offered the chance to submit your own information such as your name, email address, sex, birth date, hobbies or other items of interest. We may also be able to collect some of that information from social networking systems where you are using our Services. We may also collect information about you from other public sources, companies or individuals. In addition to the information about yourself, you may also be providing information during the usage of the Services such as in surveys, contests or other submissions. Our services may also collect aggregate information about our users.
You should also be aware that it is standard practice to collect web based browser information that helps us to improve our Services. Examples of browser based information may include information such as referring sites, website visit statistics, entry pages, exit pages and your IP address and other information available in this manner. We may also collect information regarding the usage of our Services.
Thuzi attempts to protect personal information that it collects, but these measures are not failsafe. In general we attempt to prevent the misuse of any information we collect.

USAGE OF COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS
"Cookies," are a commonly used concept on the Internet designed to store user information such as their preferences when visiting a website. We may use Cookies to improve our Services and make your web experience more personal or more convenient, but they may also be used to collect usage statistics. Web browsers contain settings allowing you to control the use of cookies and whether you want to accept them. In some cases, eliminating cookie access may make it impossible to access certain functions of our Services. It is also possible that we, or a third party advertising company may also use or provide a pixel tag, clear gif, or beacon to help manage and optimize our ability to measure the usage of our Services and to provide better online advertising. Web beacons interact with cookies to provide better information on web usage. Currently we use services provided by Yahoo, so you should review their privacy policy at http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/details.html.
