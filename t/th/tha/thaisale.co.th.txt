Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored in a browser-related file on your computer's hard drive when you use our Web site. We use cookies to improve the member experience. We also use them to deliver information and fresh content specific to your interests. Cookies are widely used on most major Web sites.
MySale mostly uses "session" cookies, which are removed from your computer once you leave MySale. These are used so our service can remember that you have logged in already and prevent you doing so more frequently. The technology we use (Microsoft .NET), requires the use of session cookies. Session cookies expire and are deleted after 30 minutes of no activity on MySale.
MySale also uses persistent cookies to personalise the user experience, to help protect our members and to provide us with research information (such as how often members visit MySale each month). Persistent cookies allow us to track users on MySale and help us identify users abusing the MySale service.

Updates to our information practices
MySale reserves the right to add to, delete or change these terms because of frequent changes in Internet technology and applicable law. As such, you should check this privacy policy from time to time for such changes.
