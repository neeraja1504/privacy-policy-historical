5.4 Intrawest shall maintain reasonable and systematic controls, schedules and practices for information and records retention and destruction which apply to personal information that is no longer necessary or relevant for the identified purposes or required or permitted by law to be retained. Such information shall be destroyed, erased or made anonymous.
5.5 Where appropriate, Intrawest may communicate updates of personal information to third parties.
5.6 Intrawest may engage affiliates or third party service providers for the purpose of providing services or processing information on behalf of Intrawest, and we may transfer or disclose personal information to such parties in connection with such purposes. Some divisions, affiliates or third party service providers may be located in other jurisdictions, and information in their custody (i) may or may not be subject to privacy legislation similar to that applicable to Intrawest, and (ii) may be subject to laws applicable in such jurisdictions that permit access to such information by foreign governments or law enforcement agencies or by others.
Principle 6 - Accuracy
Intrawest shall take steps to ensure that personal information is as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is appropriate for its purposes.

Principle 9 - Individual Access
Upon request, Intrawest shall inform an individual of the existence, use and disclosure of his or her personal information, at a minimal or no cost to the individual. An individual shall be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and have it amended as appropriate.
9.1 In certain situations, Intrawest may not be able to provide access to all the personal information that it holds about an individual. For example, Intrawest may not provide access to information if doing so would likely reveal personal information about a third party or could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of an individual. Also, Intrawest may not provide access to information if disclosure would reveal confidential commercial information, if the information is protected by solicitor-client privilege, if the information was generated in the course of a formal dispute resolution process, or if the information was collected in relation to the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a law. If access to personal information cannot be provided, Intrawest shall, upon request, provide the reasons for denying access.
9.2 In order to safeguard personal information, an individual may be required to provide sufficient identification information to permit Intrawest to authorize access to the individual's file.
9.3 Individuals can seek access to their personal information by contacting the Privacy Office at Intrawest.
