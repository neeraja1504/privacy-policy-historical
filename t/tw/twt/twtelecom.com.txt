How Do We Use Your Personally Identifiable Information?
We take the privacy of our customers and users seriously and respect your right to privacy. Personally identifiable information will be collected, processed, stored, and disposed of in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

|
supply you with our products and services (including processing any payment information for such products and services)

We may occasionally match or combine your personally identifiable information with personally identifiable information you have provided to other affiliate companies in other countries within our group in order to understand and improve the services we provide to you and to determine what other products, services or promotions may be of interest to you.
Where we process personally identifiable information in the course of our conferencing, audio or on-line services, this is done to allow us to provide the services which your company has asked us to provide, for example, by allowing us to create an authorized user ID for you, to allow you to use our services and by allowing us to provide billing and service usage information to your company.
Who Do We Share Your Information With?
We do not sell or disseminate personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent.
Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we only share your personally identifiable information with our controlled subsidiary companies and to our selected business partners who act on our behalf in order to provide the services. We make every reasonable effort to ensure that our subsidiaries and business partners, including those in the U.S. and/or any other countries in which we operate, process your personally identifiable information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
We may share non-personal, non-individual information in aggregate form with our subsidiaries or to carefully selected third parties. Your personally identifiable information may also be accessible by third-party service providers to whom we subcontract, including those who assist us in the provision of our services or who host and maintain our websites or our other services, or who provide billing and other out-sourced services to us. All such service providers must commit to complying with our instructions and to keep all personally identifiable information secure.
We may disclose personally identifiable information and account information in special cases when it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating any user agreement or may be causing injury to or interference with us, you, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities, or in response to 911 requests, or in emergency situations.  We may also disclose personally identifiable information as necessary to collect for the charges related to the services we provide.  With some services, your name and number may be transmitted and displayed on a Caller ID device unless you have elected to block such information. Caller ID Blocking does not prevent the display of your number when you dial certain business numbers, 911, 900 numbers, or toll-free 800, 888, 877 or 866 numbers. In the United States, we provide name, address and telephone number to entities that publish telephone directories and provide directory assistance.
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as explicitly set forth in this Privacy Policy or any user agreement agreed to by you, or as otherwise required by government or law enforcement officials. We can, and you hereby authorize us to, disclose any information to law enforcement or other parties that we in our sole discretion, believe is required or appropriate to comply with the law.
We may disclose, assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party, your name, address, e-mail address, member name and any other personally identifiable information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of a portion or all of our assets or stock.
How Long Do We Keep Your Information?
The length of time we keep your information for can vary according to how we use that information. Unless there is a specific legal requirement to keep your information, we will not keep it for longer than we believe is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected.
Direct Marketing
We would like to keep you up to date with details of our products and services using the information that you have supplied. We will do this in accordance with applicable privacy laws and in accordance with any direct marketing permissions which were given when we collected information from you. If you would like to change these preferences, please contact privacy@level3.com or speak to your Account Manager.
Transfers of your Information Outside of your country (including without limitation the European Economic Area (EEA))
We are a multinational group of companies and the information that we collect from you may be shared with Level 3 subsidiaries in locations around the world. All Level 3 entities comply with this Privacy Policy when they use personally identifiable information.
You should note that, subject to applicable laws, we may transfer personally identifiable information to countries where we, or our subcontractors, may store and process it.  We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that all personally identifiable information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
How to Review and Update your Information
You may request a copy of the personally identifiable information we hold about you, such as contact information, banking details and marketing preferences, and you may review, correct, update, change or delete this information at any time by submitting a request to privacy@level3.com or the local contact you have been provided for this purpose (for example, in the general terms & conditions of our services).
