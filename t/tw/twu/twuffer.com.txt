The only Personally Identifiable Information we collect via electronic mail, or our Site/App, (including any Site(s)/App(s) currently being maintained by trusted third-party providers), is (1), that which is voluntarily provided by our visitors, and (2), that which is generally found within the user’s browser, for purposes of identification.
4. TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED
a) Personally Identifiable Information
Personally Identifiable Information includes, without limitation, information such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, IP address, full user name, password, credit card data, or time zone, that is not otherwise publicly available. This information is used for internal business purposes, such as processing customer product or service orders or our own marketing activities, and is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes without your consent.
b) Non-Personal Information
In some cases, we may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable. For example, our Site/App may automatically recognize the name, URL/domain name or IP address(es) of a website, mobile App, social media platform, or advertisement, through which you navigated to reach our Site/App, but not the e-mail address of visitors to our Site, unless it is expressly provided by the visitor. The information collected is used solely for internal review.

We have your consent to share information;
We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; or
We need to send the information to companies who work on our behalf to assist us in providing our service to you, such as Site hosting and maintenance, billing, database storage or management, or direct marketing campaigns. Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the Personally Identifiable Information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us, and these parties will only be provided with the information necessary to perform services related to the Site/App, and only pursuant to agreement(s) requiring that they maintain the security and privacy of your information.
