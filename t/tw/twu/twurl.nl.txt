Tweetburner Privacy Policy
We do not collect any personally identifying information from users of this website. We store only the technical information necessary to provide our URL shortening service, such as the original long URLs. We may also store the IP addresses of computers using the Tweetburner service for the sole purposes of identifying abuse of the service and tracking anonymous usage trends. This information will not be made available to third parties.
URLs shortened by our website are not private and should not be treated as such. Third parties could easily guess the short URL that you are using, so you should not use Tweetburner to link to sensitive or secure data.
We can be reached via e-mail at info@tweetburner.com.
For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes the user’s IP address and log-in credentials (where possible).
We collect the IP address and usernames (where possible) of visitors to our Web page, aggregate information on what pages users access or visit, and user-specific information on what pages users access or visit.
The information we collect is used to customize the content and/or layout of our pages for each individual registered user.
We use cookies to store visitors preferences, record session information, customize Web page content based on users’ browser type or other information that the user sends.
From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy statement. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically.
Customers may prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by e-mailing us at the above address.
Upon request we provide site users with access to all information (including proprietary information) that we maintain about them, unique identifier information (e.g., username and password) that we maintain about them, communications that the consumer/visitor has directed to our site (e.g., e-mails, customer inquiries), contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number) that we maintain about them, and a description of information that we maintain about them.
We have no ability to correct factual inaccuracies in information that we maintain about individuals. That information is the sole responsibility of the user. For more information, see the Terms of Use.
