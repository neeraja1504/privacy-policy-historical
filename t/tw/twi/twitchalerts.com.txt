Our policy is to maintain the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information of individuals except in cases when the law requires disclosure or when we have your permission to do so. Occasionally, we may share aggregated statistics of user behavior (e.g. usage patterns, donation trends, user growth, etc.) with our partners and other interested parties. This information will never identify any individual personally or contain any personally identifiable information.
TwitchAlerts does not sell, lease, share, rent, or otherwise provide any personally identifiable information for marketing purposes to any companies or persons outside of TwitchAlerts. We may provide your personally identifiable information to service providers and affiliates that provide services in conjunction with our offerings, such as payment processors, fraud protection services, or other parties assisting in improving TwitchAlerts. Information is securely transmitted to these affiliates, and such affiliates will only receive information necessary to provide their respective services and will be bound by confidentiality agreements limiting the use of such information. Please be aware that any personal information that you voluntarily choose to display in any public location through the use of our platform becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others.
TwitchAlerts will only disclose personally identifiable information to government officials and law enforcement agencies when it is required by law (e.g. in compliance with a subpoena or court order) or if we believe in good faith that such action is appropriate and necessary to protect and defend the rights of TwitchAlerts, or to protect the safety of TwitchAlerts users, employees, affiliates, and the general public.

Links
The TwitchAlerts website contains links to other sites that are not under our direct control.

Information collected by such technologies will be disclosed to or collected by these services providers, who use this information to evaluate your use of TwitchAlerts. You may choose to opt out of their services if you do not wish to have your information collected by them.
Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web brosers. DNT is a way for users to tell websites and services that they do not want certain information about their visits collected. We currently do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals at this time though, as the Internet industry is currently working towards accepted standardization and practices around DNT.
Data Security
TwitchAlerts has strict security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of information under our control. We use secure technology, privacy protection controls, and restrictions on employee access in order to safeguard your information.

Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job, such as billing or customer service, are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/serves in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
Please note that while we continually make every effort to implement safeguards to protect your personal information, the very nature of the Internet makes it impossible to guarantee the security of transmitted data. TwitchAlerts makes no warranties or representations as to the security and confidentiality of any data you transmit. Any data you transmit to TwitchAlerts is at your own risk, and we cannot guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by any breach of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
