I. TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
1. Personally Identifying Information

For instance, when you register for any portion of our services or send us an email for one of our contests, you are asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, name or phone number. Optional information such as your age, location, or gender may also be requested.
We use personally identifying information you directly supply through the Website to provide you with the service you have requested. For example, if you create an account on our Website, we may use your e-mail address to send you notifications that relate to your account. Likewise, if you enter an online sweepstakes, we will use your supplied personally identifying information to notify you if you are a winner. We may also use personally identifying information you supply to communicate with you about new features, products or services, and/or to improve the services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs.
Additionally, we may use personally identifying information you supply in cookies we place on your computer. For example, if you login to our Website and you request to be remembered, your login and encrypted password will be stored in that cookie. Please be cognizant that that the presence of our cookie could be tracked or accessed by third-parties or affiliates.
Unless otherwise specified on the Website or stated in relation to a specific promotion, we will not sell, share, trade, or otherwise provide any personally identifying information you have given us to any third-party or affiliate. We do reserve the right to allow access to our database by contracted third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance and hosted software, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those services.
If you do not wish to receive future communications from us by e-mail, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the e-mail; or if you've registered on any part of the Website and you received communications pursuant to your account, please use the mechanism on the Website that allows you to change or update your email preferences and contact information or remove your account.
There are also times when you provide information about yourself to us in areas of the site that may be managed or participated in by third parties, such as e-commerce. In such cases, the information may be used by us and by such third party(ies), each pursuant to its own policies.
We may also provide access to our database in order to cooperate with official investigations or legal proceedings, including, for example, in response to subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, or other legal process.
2. Non-Personally Identifiable Information
Our servers, like most web servers, create log files, which contain information about your computer and your Internet connection that is transmitted when you visit and use our Website. This information includes, but is not limited to the type of browser software you use, the operating system you are running, your screen resolution, the website that referred you, the page you left the site on, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. Your IP address is usually associated with the location from which you access the Internet, like your local Internet Service Provider, your company or your university. We may also be tracking the links you click and the number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, and track user's movement.
We generally analyze this type of information in the aggregate to gather broad demographic information and look overall usage patterns in order to improve our Website.
We also employ third parties to track and capture this same Non-Personally Identifiable Information in order to validate our own internal measurements, allow us access to deeper analysis tools then we have available on our server, and to allow independent verification of usage to our advertisers. Please be aware that our Privacy Policy does not cover information collected by these third parties.
We reserve the right to use the information we collect about your computer, in concert information which may at times be able to identify you, for any lawful business purpose, including without limitation to help diagnose problems with our servers, to gather broad demographic information, and to otherwise administer our Website.
