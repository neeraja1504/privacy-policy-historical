Privacy Policy | TWAS
Why a privacy policy?
This policy describes how twas.org is managed with regard to the processing of personal data of visitors who use it and who interact with the web services offered by TWAS, established in Strada Costiera 11, 34151 Trieste, Italy.
This policy is a disclosure provided pursuant to Section 13 of the Italian Legislative Decree no. 196 of 30 June 2003, (Code for the protection of personal data; for brevity referred to hereafter as the "Code"). It only applies to this website and does not concern other websites that may be accessed by the user via links.
The information provided is also based on the guidelines in the Recommendation No. 2/2001, which was adopted on 17 May 2001 by the European data protection authorities within the Working group set up under Article 29 of European Directive 95/46/EC in order to establish minimum requirements for the collection of personal data online, and, in particular, the manner, timing and the nature of the information to be provided by data controllers to users when they visit the web pages regardless of the purpose.
What is meant by personal data?
Personal Data is every piece of information related to a natural or legal person, body or association, identified or identifiable, also indirectly, through reference to any other information (such as a number or an ID code.)
Particularly important are:
“identification data”: personal data which allow direct identification of a person (e.g. the first and the last name, email address, Tax ID as well as an image, the recording of one’s voice or one’s fingerprint, or medical, accounting or financial information of that person);
“sensitive data”: personal data requiring special precautions on account of its nature; sensitive data are any data which may reveal a person’s racial origin or ethnicity, religious or other beliefs, political opinions, membership of parties, trade unions and/or associations, state of health or sex life;
“judicial data”: personal data which can reveal certain judicial measures which required inclusion in the person’s criminal record (for example, final criminal convictions; paroling; residency and/or movement restrictions; and alternatives to detention). The fact of being a defendant and/or the subject of criminal investigations falls within the scope of this definition as well.
With the evolution of the new technologies, other personal information have taken on a significant role, such as those relating to electronic communications (via the Internet or telephone) and those which enable the geo-location, by providing information about frequented and travelled to places.

What does “processing” mean and who are the subjects involved?
Processing (personal data) is an operation or set of operations concerning the personal data.
The code definition is wide-ranging as it includes collection, recording, organization, storage, modification, selection, extraction, usage, blockage, communication, dissemination, cancelation and destruction of data. Each of these operations is a form of data processing.
The individual, the company, the association or any other entity that is actually in control of the processing of personal data is the “data controller”. It is empowered to take the essential decisions on the purposes and mechanisms of such processing including the applicable security measures (Section 4, par 1, let. f), of the Code.
If the personal data is processed by a company or a public administrative body, it is the entity as a whole that acts as the data controller rather than the individual or department/unit that manages or represents such entity (e.g. Chairman, CEO, auditor, Minister, General Director, etc.). The cases where an individual is the data controller mostly concern processing operations performed by self-employed professionals or single-person corporations.
The data controller may entrust with specific data processing management and control tasks of an individual, company, association or organization, even outsider, designated as “data processor” on account of the relevant experience and/or skills. (Section 4, par. 1, let. g), of the Code.
An employee or a co-worker that processes or actually uses personal data on behalf of the Data Controller's organization in accordance with the instructions given by the Data Controller and/or the Data Processor (if the latter has been appointed) is a “persons in charge of the processing” (Section 4, par. 1, let. h), of the Code.
“Data subject” is the individual to which the personal data relates.
