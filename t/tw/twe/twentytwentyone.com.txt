Security Policy
Internet security technology
When you place an order with us using our secure online order form and web browser, the order is encrypted. The use of SSL encryption scrambles data sent from the browser to the twentytwentyone.com server in a way that only Twentytwentyone can access. We also use fraud checking systems to verify your identity.
Checking your browser security
You will notice that when you look at the location (URL) field at the top of the browser it begins with https: instead of the normal http: This means that you are in secure mode. You can also verify the security of a document by checking the security icon at the bottom-right hand corner of your browser (usually a lock and key padlock or a solid gold key depending on your browser and version). This is your assurance that your browser and server are communicating securely. All information transmitted on our secure online order form is encrypted while in transit, so that even if the information is intercepted because it is encrypted, it is useless to anyone. When our Secure Payment Server has received your credit card information it is sent directly and encrypted to the Sage Pay server and will never be stored or saved at the Twentytwentyone website.
Security of your personal data is of highest priority to us. This is why we have utilised encryption technology to guarantee unauthorised parties have no access to personal and credit card details as they are passed over the internet. This has been independently verified.
