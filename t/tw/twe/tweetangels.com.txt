When you use the Service, Company’s systems and administrators may collect various types of personal information to enable Company to provide the Service, as well as certain features of the Service or interaction with third-parties or Third-Party Services.
Company may collect non-personally-identifying information, such as browser types, language preferences, referring sites, date and time of visitor requests, server information, usage metrics, previous activities and duration of sessions, to better understand how the Service is being used and deliver reliable and enhanced functionality.
Company may collect potentially personally-identifying information, such as Internet Protocol addresses, media access control addresses, network routes, technical data, user and usage statistics, traffic patterns and popularity of information shared via the Service, to better understand how the Service is being used.
Company may collect personally-identifying information, such as names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, payment information and verified identity data to implement specific features or functions. The exact nature and type of personally-identifying information collected will vary according to the feature, such as providing contact details to create a verified account, if applicable.
Company uses both non-personally-identifying information and potentially personally-identifying information to enhance functionality of the Service, resolve technical errors, provide you with the correct and most up to date version of the Service and to improve the overall accessibility of the Service.
Please note that any information you submit to forums, message boards or Third-Party Services may be publicly viewable. In such event, any privacy rights you may have concerning the submitted information will be released. Public disclosure of information via such methods may also cause you to receive unwanted communications.
Company will only disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to those officers, directors, employees, agents or contractors that have a legitimate need to know such information. In such cases, those officers, directors, employees, agents or contractors to whom potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information is disclosed will have signed a non-disclosure agreement with Company prohibiting any unauthorized disclosure.
Company may release aggregated forms of non-personally-identifying information and technical data to third-parties for informational or research purposes. However, Company will not disclose personally-identifying information without your explicit consent, except to the extent legally required or necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims and process, in the event of an emergency pertaining to your health or safety, if you violate Company’s Terms of Service or compelled to do so by court order or applicable law
Company has taken commercially reasonable technical and organizational security measures against loss or unauthorized processing of potentially personally-identifying or personally-identifying information, including without limitation, the use of encryption, firewalls and Secure Sockets Layer and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard protocols. Additionally, Company implements general industry security standards as well as physical safeguards of the locations where such information is stored.
When you provide Company with potentially personally-identifying or personally-identifying information, you consent to Company’s collection of such information and explicitly authorize Company to use it to provide the Service for you access or use.
