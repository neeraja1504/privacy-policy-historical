Teads Advertising Service Policy | Teads.tv
Teads is an advertising marketplace that proposes innovative advertising solutions to Publishers and Advertisers all over Europe, USA, Latin America and Asia.
Publishers use Teads advertising solutions to monetize their ad spaces either directly or through Teads advertising demand including other advertising buyer partners.
Advertisers or their intermediaries (eg. media agencies) display their advertising campaigns through Teads advertising solutions on the websites or apps of our publishers partners.
Teads advertising technology collects and uses data to help make online advertising more relevant as well as for ad delivery and reporting purposes.
Scope of this privacy policy
Teads SA., together with its affiliates (“Teads”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) recognizes the importance of privacy and is committed to providing transparency and control over the use of the data in online advertising.
This privacy policy details Teads data practices on how we collect, use, process and share the data we may collect through our advertising services as well as the ways in which individuals may exercise control over the use of information collected by us.
Teads does not collect or process any information that allows identifying a particular individual directly.
We do not collect or process information related to (i) name, user address, place of work, date of birth, email address, or phone number (ii) hardware-based identifiers such as UDID or MAC Address and (iii) sensitive information (such as religion, political opinion, health…).
We do not create segments to specifically target children under 16 years old.
In order to deliver personalized ads as well as non-personalized ads, Teads uses 3 methods to single out users depending on the device they use, web or mobile and operating system :
Cookie-based identification
Teads drops a cookie on the user web and/or mobile browser. Cookies are used to single out a user and store a randomly generated identifier to identify his browser across visits.
Cookie-less environments
For some environments – for example, Apple devices using Safari browser – Teads uses an identification methodology based on IP address non-reversible encryption, browser used and operating system. This method allows to single out a user in order to cap the number of times the same ad is shown to the same user.
Advertising ID
Teads uses its SDK technology for mobile applications. For Google Android operating system, we use the Google Advertising ID and for Apple iOS the IDFA.
2. Information we collect
We collect data through our web tags on publisher web pages, or through our Software Development Kit within publisher mobile Apps.
Collected data are :
Page URL
Browser Information  (eg: Browser name and version)
Device Information  (eg: Device type, OS)
Network carrier information  (eg: Wifi, 4G or Wired connection)
Non-precise Location information  (eg: Country and City, derived from user IP)
Mobile application information  (eg: Application name or IDFA)
User Interactions with Teads Ad  (eg: clicks or video views)
IP address
To improve advertising relevance for users, Teads uses other data coming from trusted providers in order to infer general users interests (eg. socio-demographic, brand affinity).
We use the information we collect to deliver our services:
Targeting:  We use data to filter the ad delivery according to user interests, user location, device used or page content.
User frequency Capping:  We use data to prevent displaying too many times the same ad to the same user.
Analytics:  We use collected data for monitoring and reporting the campaign delivery for advertisers and publishers and for internal business analysis.
Ad Delivery:  We transmit collected data to to programmatic buyers so that they can deliver their campaigns.
Delivery Algorithm training:  We use collected data in order to improve our service and technology.
Cross device experience:  To provide a consolidated experience through the different device or browser environments, we may link the Teads identifiers on the different browsers and environments the user is using.
4. Data sent to Teads partners
In order to be able to deliver an ad and measure its performance, we need to share data with our different partners. These companies are authorized to use the information we provide only as necessary to provide these services.
Viewability measurement.  We transmit data to companies specialized in campaign measurement such as MOAT or IAS in order to verify that our ads are viewable.
Fraud detection.  We transmit data to companies such as DoubleVerify in order to prevent delivering our ads on fraudulent traffic, such as non-human traffic.
Brand Safety.  We transmit data to companies such as Grapeshot in order to prevent displaying our Ads on content that can damage an advertiser’s Brand.
Analytics and Audience measurement.  We transmit data to companies such as Nielsen, ComScore or Mediametrie in order to measure the demographics of our audience.
We do also send data to  Programmatic Buyers  using Demand Side Platforms such as Google DoubleClick Bid Manager, who buy our ad placements through programmatic auctions.
5. Data retention and storage
We retain the data linked to a user up to 12 months from the date of collection.
We may also store aggregated and non-personal data for a longer period than 12 months for financial and statistical reasons.
For security reasons, user’ IP address is stored in a private security log for a period of 4 months.
Teads uses generally accepted industry security standards to protect data.
