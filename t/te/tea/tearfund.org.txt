We maintain a high level of security in relation to the collection, storage and disclosure of your information. This is very important to us and we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information we hold about you is safe.
We use secure software (SSL) whenever financial information is required. This is designed to encrypt information given over the internet to protect all personal data.

The data we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination within or outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.

We may need to pass on information if required by law or by a regulatory body. For example, a Gift Aid audit by the HMRC, or if asked for details by a law enforcement agency.
We may provide third parties with general information about users of our site, but this information is both aggregate and anonymous. However, we may use IP address information to identify a user if we feel that there are or may be safety and/or security issues or to comply with legal requirements.
