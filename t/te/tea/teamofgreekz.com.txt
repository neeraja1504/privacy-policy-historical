Some other information is provided "passively" - meaning, that TeamOfGreekz.com obtains this information when you login to your TeamOfGreekz.com account and use the service. This is done primarily through the use of "cookies." Cookies are used on TeamOfGreekz.com to verify your login information, and to optionally store your password in your browser so that you do not need to type it in each time you visit. Any time that you point your browser to a 'members-only' area, TeamOfGreekz.com checks your browser's cookie file to see if you have already logged in, and if you have, you're taken right to the page that you have requested.

Cookies
TeamOfGreekz.com uses cookies to customize your experience while using the Forums. A cookie is a small text file that many Web sites write through your browser when you visit them. A cookie can only be read by the site that places it, so TeamOfGreekz.com can't "see where you've been" based on any other cookies in your browser. Cookies are generally supported in version 3.0 and newer of Internet Explorer, 2.02 and newer of Netscape, and 3.0 and newer of AOL. Netscape Navigator uses a single file called "cookies.txt" to record all cookies, and you can open this file in any text editor to see what it looks like. On a Macintosh computer, the Netscape cookie file is called "MagicCookie". Internet Explorer uses a separate file for each cookie, which typically reside in "C:\Windows\Profiles\User\Cookies." Most browsers also allow the option of displaying a warning before accepting a cookie, or refusing all cookies. Declining cookies while participating in forums may result in some of features not working properly.
