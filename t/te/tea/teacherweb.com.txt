TeacherWeb® Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy was developed to give you a full understanding of the terms and conditions relating to information collected through your TeacherWeb® website and TeacherWeb® school website. This information also pertains to TeacherWebQuest and any academic use of TeacherWeb site functionality.

I.Registration; Information We Collect
You may visit TeacherWeb® sites as a guest without registering. Teachers and other school personnel will be required to register to update and maintain TeacherWeb sites. Registration, however, will give you access to certain features as well as the ability to personalize certain features which are not available to non-registrants.
A. Personally Identifiable Information
TeacherWeb collects personal information via registration and through features of TeacherWeb® as explained below.
Registration occurs in the following ways:
Self-Registration. You may register for a TeacherWeb® site if you meet the criteria outlined in our Terms and Conditions. At the time of registration, we will collect personally identifiable information.
School-Registration (i.e. “Pre-Registration”). Your school may register for a TeacherWeb® site on your behalf, including setting up the site and inputting your personally identifiable information.
TeacherWeb Assisted Registration: TeacherWeb may create a site on your behalf using information that you or your school provides.

Details of Self-Registration.
If you choose to become a registered guest, we will ask for personal information from you through your organization's site powered by TeacherWeb. After we collect this information from you, it may be verified by an official at your organization. Children under 13 years of age are not allowed to register themselves with your organization's TeacherWeb site or the MyTeacherWeb.com service. Before a child under 13 may access features that require registration, the organization must first obtain a signed parental consent form or the student must confirm that they have parental permission to register. If you have questions regarding your profile, please contact your organization's Primary Contact to TeacherWeb.
1. If you are over 13 years of age, you are required to supply your First and Last Name, Email Address, Sign-In Name and Password and other required fields to use personalization features of TeacherWeb®, including MyTeacherWeb.com.
