Australian Privacy Principles
In Australia, the Australian Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act (1988) (Cth govern the handling of personal information. In this privacy policy, the term “personal information” has the meaning in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and includes information about an identifiable individual, including their name, gender, date of birth, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address, drivers’ licence details, credit information and history, banking details, photographs, employment details and if and where applicable, information that constitutes “sensitive information”. “Personal information” includes an opinion about an identifiable individual.
“Sensitive information” is a subset of personal information and includes information about a person’s racial or ethnic origin, health information, political opinions, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional or trade association or trade union, sexual preferences or practices and criminal record.
1. Collection of personal information
We collect some personal information about individuals. We collect personal information from individuals in circumstances such as the following:
When we meet or deal with an individual from an organisation wishing to do business with us;
When a person signs up to become a user of the App and/or when a person becomes an administrator (“Club App Administrator”) of a team or a club’s tailored app created using the App (collectively “Club App”);
When a user posts content that includes personal information through the App or a Club App;
When a user visits the Website or uses the App or a Club App and sends an enquiry through or makes a comment or other post, through an email or via a social media platform;
When a user signs up to receive marketing information;
When we evaluate job applicants and personnel, which may include collection of details such as employment history and educational qualifications; and
Where you are required to pay to purchase goods or services from us or third parties through the Website, the App or a Club App, we (or a financial services provider engaged by us or a third party) will (or that third party) also collect financial information such as credit card information, your mailing address etc.
A significant amount of personal information is primarily collected by Club App Administrators. However, because the information resides on our database we technically “collect” it, although we would not typically access or analyse it. This information could include a range of information as selected by the Club App Administrator, such as names, dates of birth, address, phone number, occupation, employment details, health information, private insurance status, details of ambulance cover, and other information as selected by the Club App Administrator.

Rejecting cookies may have the effect of limiting your access to parts of the Website.
