Privacy Policy - TeachEngineering
TeachEngineering is committed to respecting the privacy of those who visit our web sites, and those who choose to subscribe or register for information, services, TeachEngineering activities, or TeachEngineering events. We have created this privacy policy to demonstrate our commitment to respect that privacy. Please review the TeachEngineering Privacy Policy set forth below so that you can understand your options in using the TeachEngineering web site or service.
This privacy policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (e.g. first and last names, email address, a home or physical address, a telephone number, institution or affiliation) that TeachEngineering may hold. You can visit any TeachEngineering web site without identifying who you are, or revealing personally identifiable information.
Any personally identifiable information TeachEngineering obtains about a user of its web sites, services, search systems, events, or activities is information supplied voluntarily by the user as part of using the TeachEngineering web site, or signing up for a particular service, activity or event, or in requesting information from TeachEngineering.
TeachEngineering is not responsible for the privacy practices of non TeachEngineering web sites, services or organizations to which a TeachEngineering web site, document or service may link, refer, or recommend.
At this time, TeachEngineering uses the personal information that you provide in order to record and support your activities within TeachEngineering web sites and web-based services, to provide you information about TeachEngineering and related activities or events, and support your participation in activities and events. TeachEngineering does not sell, rent, or share any personal information that it collects on its web sites or web-based services, or in organizing any activity or event. TeachEngineering reserves the right, however, to change this policy, and will give you sufficient notice prior to doing so to allow you to "opt-in" to having your information shared.
Personal information about TeachEngineering members and users may, from time to time, be shared with outside contractors, auditors, consultants, collaborators, and others contracted by TeachEngineering to assist in carrying out financial or operational activities. TeachEngineering informs recipients of information about safeguarding personal information, and requires them to use it only for an authorized purpose consistent with this privacy policy, and to return it or destroy it upon completion of the activity.
TeachEngineering will disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal processes served to you, TeachEngineering , or the site.
TeachEngineering web sites and TeachEngineering search and discovery systems maintain both raw log files and an organized database of documents retrieved and search queries entered. Information extracted from these log files (e.g., the pages requested, referral URLs, estimation of time spent on a page, estimation of a user session, result sets from search queries) is processed in aggregate to help TeachEngineering gauge the effectiveness of its web sites and services, improve the performance and structure of its web sites and services, and for generating general use statistics. TeachEngineering may share this type of information with its collaborators, sponsors and contractors to evaluate and improve the site and may publish these aggregate data as the result of academic research.
In order to use some TeachEngineering services, a user may be required to have a persistent identifier (e.g. a login identifier.) These identifiers may link to personally identifiable information the user supplies TeachEngineering as part of registering or signing up for a service. These identifiers will not be linked to general use information except where the user has explicitly agreed to this action when signing up for the service (and where it may be a requirement to use the service) or when a user has volunteered to participate in an evaluation study of library collection use.
IP Addresses and domain names are included in both the raw log files and the organized database and are used in helping to compute aggregate statistics (e.g., as a basis for defining a use session.) These IP Addressess are not used to link TeachEngineering use to any other personally identifiable information that TeachEngineering may hold.
A TeachEngineering web site or service may use cookies to improve the user's interaction with the site or service. TeachEngineering does not use cookies to track visitors except in conjunction with a service that requires keeping track of a user's sessions, or actions, (e.g., a service allowing a user to see a history of their previous search queries).
TeachEngineering hosts and maintains publicly viewable curriculum reviews and suggestions for curriculum improvements submitted by its users. Users should note that that any information they post as a review or as a suggestion for curriculum improvement is available to all persons accessing TeachEngineering.
Students are advised to consult with their parents or teachers before registering for any service or giving any personal information online.
