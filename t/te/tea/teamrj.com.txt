5. Security and Passwords
The personally identifiable information we collect about you is stored in limited access servers. John Cottrell & Ress Benson intends to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect such information from unauthorized access or disclosure. While we make efforts to ensure that your information is secure on our system, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
When your password is requested on this Site, we use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to present secure pages to protect that information. You can tell if you are using a secure server by looking at the bottom of your browser window. In Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, you will see a lock icon. When the symbol is unbroken or the padlock appears to be in its closed state, the page is encrypted and therefore secure. If you wish to take advantage of the latest encryption standards, be sure you have the latest version of the browser you use. You can download the latest version from the Netscape or Microsoft web sites. Using beta versions of browsers is not recommended.
You can change your password at any time, and you can set a new password in case you forgot your old one which is accessible from our home page. Please keep your password in a safe place and do not to divulge it to anyone. Also remember to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit. This is especially important if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or Internet cafe.
Your account is protected by your password. You choose a password when you first start an account with us. Your password needs to:
- be at least 5 characters long (case sensitive)
- include both numbers and letters
- not contain symbols (*, $, #, %, etc.)
Make sure to select a password that is not obvious. A good password includes seemingly random letters and numbers, for example, F3M8N1.
