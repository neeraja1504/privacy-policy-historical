Privacy Policy - TeachThought
Who We Are
We are TeachThought, LLC., a small, family-owned company operated (almost exclusively) by one person (Founder/Director Terry Heick), a former classroom teacher with a family and four children. We are not a large company by design, as we seek to keep business operating costs low to ensure sustainability in our mission–to innovate education through the growth of innovative teachers.
Terry Heick can be reached through email or phone at 502.407.1201. Additionally, you can find him on twitter, as well as other social media platforms.
We also provide professional development for teachers across the world through our sister company, TeachThought Professional Development, LLC owned and operated by Drew Perkins.
Occasionally, services such as cybersecurity, social media management, graphic design, and more are contracted out by Mr. Heick when he lacks the time, tools, or expertise to perform duties necessary to operate TeachThought, LLC.
