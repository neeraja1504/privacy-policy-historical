Processing of Personal Information contained in User Content
The Supplier does not own, control or direct the use of any of the information stored or processed by You via the Services.

The Supplier is largely unaware of what information is actually being stored or made available by You to the Platform and the Services and does not directly access such information or data except as authorised by the Client or as necessary to provide Services to the Client.
Because the Supplier does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Information contained in the User Content and because it does not determine the purposes for which such Personal Information is collected, the means of collecting such Personal Information or the uses of such information, the Supplier is not acting in the capacity of data controller in terms of the European Union’s Directive 95/46/EC on data privacy (hereinafter referred to as the “Directive”) and does not have the associated responsibilities under the Directive.

Such actions are performed or authorised only by the applicable Client or User.
The Client or the User is the data controller under the Directive for any User Content containing Personal Information, meaning that such party controls the manner such Personal Information is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such Personal Information. The Supplier is not responsible for the content of the Personal Information contained in the User Content or other information stored on its servers (or its subcontractors’ servers) at the discretion of the Client or User nor is the Supplier responsible for the manner in which the Client or User collects, handles disclosure, distributes or otherwise processes such information.
