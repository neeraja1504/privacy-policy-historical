1. Introduction
This policy covers the Teach-ICT's use of personal information that Teach-ICT collects when you use teach-ict.com. The policy also gives you information about cookies; Teach-ICT and third parties' use of cookies; and how you may reject such cookies.
In order to set up a subscription with us, you must first of all be a teacher. The details we need to store are your name, contact email address - preferably your official school email address, and the school name and address. We only use the information for our own administration use - nothing will ever get passed on to third parties.
By providing this information you enable the Teach-ICT and its service providers to provide you with the services you select. Whenever you provide such personal information we will treat that information in accordance with this policy. When using your personal information Teach-ICT will act in accordance with current legislation and aim to meet current Internet best practice. This includes the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
2. Visitor Information : general
A 'cookie' is a short text file that is stored in the application area of your browser.
Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the computer (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.
Information supplied by cookies can help provide you with a better online user experience.
STATEMENT: Teach-ICT does not use or store cookies at all.
3. What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.
Cookies record information about your online preferences. Users have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these, of course, means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user user and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the teach-ict.com features. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
If you have set your computer to reject cookies you can still browse teach-ict.com anonymously until such time as you wish to register for teach-ict.com services. For further information on cookies please visit http://www.aboutcookies.org.
4. Use and storage of your personal information
When you supply any personal information to teach-ict.com (e.g. for teach-ict.com services or teach-ict.com membership) we have legal obligations towards you in the way we use those data. We must collect the information fairly, that is, we must explain how we will use it.
In general, any information you provide to the Teach-ICT will only be used within Teach-ICT and by its agents and service providers. Your information will be disclosed only where we are obliged or permitted by law. Also, if you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on or to teach-ict.com or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on teach-ict.com, Teach-ICT can use whatever information that is available to it about you to stop such behaviour. This may involve informing relevant third parties such as your employer, school e-mail/Internet provider and law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.
We will hold your personal information on our systems only for as long it is of practical use for running the service you signed up for. For safety reasons, however, the Teach-ICT may store messaging transcript or activity data (including message content, member names, times and dates) arising from the use of teach-ict.com services for a period of eight months.
We neither ask for nor store any personal or identifiable information on students (or the public) visiting the site.
We will ensure that all personal information supplied is held securely, in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and the new GDPR.
If you are notified on the teach-ict.com site that your information may be used to allow the Teach-ICT to contact you for "service administration purposes", this means that Teach-ICT may contact you for a number of purposes related to the service you have signed up for. For example, we may wish to provide you with password reminders or notify you that the particular service has been suspended for maintenance.
