This policy (the “ Privacy Policy ”) describes the information we collect on www.teachingchannel.org, including personally identifiable information, in connection with our Services, and explains how we use and disclose this information. By accessing and/or using our website, currently located at www.teachingchannel.org (the “Site”), you agree to be bound by the provisions of this Privacy Policy.
Please note that this Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and made a part of, the Teaching Channel Terms and Conditions (the " Terms "). Capitalized terms used and not defined in this policy have the meaning given to them in the Terms.
What We Collect

Surveys or Contests
From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests, sweepstakes or surveys on the site which require you to disclose certain personally identifiable information in order to participate. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).
How We Disclose Information
We may disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties in a variety of circumstances in connection with developing and providing our Services and operating our business. For example:
Our Site enables users to communicate in a variety of ways. Any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to include in a publicly accessible area on our Services, such as in a blog discussion, user review or other User Submission, will be publicly available to others. This also applies to information you choose to make available through our features that connect to third party services, such as Twitter and Facebook. Teaching Channel may also syndicate content posted in public areas to other third party services. Once you make your personally identifiable information publicly available and accessible, that information may be collected and used by others without restriction. Similarly, information you make available to another user or users through private or semi-private communication channel may be collected and used by the recipients without restriction.
Teaching Channel discloses automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist such parties in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on our Services.
Teaching Channel works with third party service providers to provide website hosting and maintenance as well as other services, such as sweepstakes administration. To the extent it is necessary for these service providers to complete their contractual obligations to Teaching Channel, these third parties may have access to or process your personally identifiable information. Generally, these disclosures are made under terms comparable to this policy, and the recipients are limited to using the information for the purpose for which it was provided. For example, Teaching Channel may provide your payment information (and supporting personally identifiable information) to a third party payment processor in connection with processing your payments for subscription fees.
Teaching Channel may also disclose your information if required to do so by law, where we believe that such action is necessary to comply with state or federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law), in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement activity.
Teaching Channel also reserves the right to disclose your information that we believe, in our sole discretion, is appropriate or useful to protect you, other users, third parties, or ourselves from harm or liability; to protect Teaching Channel and others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity; to investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations; to assist government and law enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of our Services; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Teaching Channel, our users, or others. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.
Tell-A-Friend
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Services, share a video or other aspect of the Services, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Site. Teaching Channel stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.
Your friend may contact us at privacy@teachingchannel.org to request that we remove this information from our database.

Our Commitment to Children's Privacy
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Teaching Channel does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years of age. IF YOU ARE NOT 13 YEARS-OF-AGE OR OLDER YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE THE SITE OR SUBMIT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO TEACHING CHANNEL. If Teaching Channel learns that personally identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected through our Service, then Teaching Channel will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has posted, submitted or otherwise communicated personally identifiable information to our Service without your consent, then you may alert Teaching Channel at privacy@teachingchannel.org so that we may take appropriate action to remove the child's personally identifiable information from our systems.
Our Commitment to Data Security
Teaching Channel uses certain industry standard managerial and technical safeguards to increase the integrity and security of personally identifiable information stored on our systems. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to Teaching Channel, nor can we guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach, circumvention, failure, or interruption of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
If Teaching Channel learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may post a notice through our Site if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at privacy@teachingchannel.org.
