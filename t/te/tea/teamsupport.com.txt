We may disclose Personal Data that we collect or you provide:
To our subsidiaries and affiliates.

Any successor in interest to this Privacy Policy will be bound to the Privacy Policy at the time of transfer.

Customer Data
“Customer Data” means any and all data, information or material provided or submitted by Customers to TeamSupport by any means, including Personal Data of Customer employees, contractors, and End-Users. We only process Customer Data as per our Customer's instructions. For purposes of the GDPR and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, we are the processor and not the controller of the Customer Data. Our European Economic Area (“ EEA ”) or Switzerland based customers are the “controllers” of that data and are responsible for compliance with the applicable data protection law. We work with our Customers to help them provide notice to their End-Users concerning the purpose for which Personal Data is processed by TeamSupport.
As the controller, it is our Customers’ responsibility to inform End-Users about the processing, and, where required, obtain necessary consent or authorization for any Personal Data that is collected as part of the Customer Data. As the processors of Personal Data on behalf of our customers, we follow customer’s instructions with respect to the Customer Data to the extent consistent with the functionality of our Services. In doing so, we implement technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, Personal Data.
Data Security: How We Protect Data We Hold
We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to secure your Personal Data from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. Please see our security information page here. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your Personal Data. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL or TLS technology.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Site or Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Site and Services like company profile pages or message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Site.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data transmitted to the Site or Services. Any transmission of Personal Data is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site or Services.
International Transfer of Personal Data
TeamSupport stores personal information about visitors and Customers within the United States, the EEA, and in other countries and territories in which we, or our contractors, operate. To provide you with the Site or Services, we may transfer and access such Personal Data from around the world. If you are using the Site or Services from the EEA or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your Personal Data to the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Such countries may have laws which are different, and potentially not as protective, as the laws of your own country. Whenever we share Personal Data originating in the EEA, we will rely on lawful measures to transfer that data, such as the EU standard contractual clauses. By providing your Personal Data, you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data (EEA Only)
With respect to Personal Data collected from individuals from the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. Our Company will normally collect Personal Data only where: (a) we have specific consent to do so, (b) where we need the Personal Data to fulfil a contract with a Visitor or Customer, or (c) where the processing is in our or a third party’s legitimate interests (and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms).
If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data). Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time why we need to use your Personal Data. If we process Personal Data in reliance on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Data, please contact us using the contact details provided below.
