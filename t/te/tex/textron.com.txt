Provision of the website and creation of logfiles
Every time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the calling computer. Here, the following data is collected:
Information about the browser type and version used
The IP address of the user

The data is also stored in the log files of our system. Storage of this data together with other personal data of the user does not take place.

An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.

If we have reason to believe that information is being provided by a child under the age of 18, Textron Inc. will not collect the information without parental consent or parent notification, which will include the opportunity for the parent to prevent the use of the information or to prevent the child's participation in the activity. Without parental consent, online information will only be used to respond to an unsolicited request and for no other purposes.
