In addition, Textbooks.com shares your personal information with third party providers of products and services. These are third party providers of products and services you may purchase from or through us (e.g., Marketplace on Textbooks.com Purchases). These third parties do not have the right to use personal information we provide to them in any way that is not authorized by Textbooks.com. They are contractually obligated to use such information only as necessary to assist us and to maintain the confidentiality and security of such information. For specific information regarding our rental service provided by Chegg, please review our Rental Terms of Use & Privacy Policy.
Except as described below, Textbooks.com will not disclose your Personal Information to third parties who are not our affiliates without your consent. We do not sell or exchange customer lists or customer information for marketing purposes with non-affiliated third parties, and will not do so without your express permission. We may share anonymous, aggregate information concerning the demographic makeup of our customers to non-affiliated third parties.
We may share Personal Information we collect for business purposes with companies and individuals who provide servicing, administrative, marketing, and other services for us, or on our behalf. Companies we hire to provide such services are only permitted, by contract, to use your information for the performance of the specific services we have requested of them. We use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. They do not know the name, phone number, address, email address, or any personally identifying information about the user. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used by our third party service provider, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative's website by clicking here.
On occasion, Textbooks.com enters into agreements with non-affiliated third parties under which Textbooks.com provides the third party a commission, or other financial remuneration, based upon the third party's advertising to, or referral of, customers. We may share your Personal Information with such third parties to verify that you have obtained products or services from Textbooks.com, or to verify that Textbooks.com is in compliance with any agreements between Textbooks.com and the third party.
Textbooks.com may share your Personal Information with others as required, or permitted, by law. This may include sharing your Personal Information with third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process. This may also include sharing your Personal Information with third parties if we believe that doing so is necessary to exercise our legal rights, defend against legal claims, defend against potential legal claims, apply the terms of any of our policies or user agreements, or otherwise protect the rights, property, or safety of Textbooks.com, our users, or others.
In the event that Textbooks.com, or substantially all of Textbooks.com's assets, are acquired, your Personal Information will be transferred to the acquiring company. In such a situation, you will be provided with notice that a transfer of your Personal Information is imminent, and you will be given an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of your Personal Information.

Automatically collected information. Textbooks.com's web servers automatically collect anonymous information about a visitor's IP address, browser type and referrer by reading this information from your browser. This information is collected in a database and is used to help us recognize you each time you return to our site. This information is automatically logged by most websites.
Information collected using cookies. Textbooks.com may use various kinds of software devices, such as "cookies" to collect information about Internet use. These small files identify your browser and save information such as passwords so that websites can recognize you. You can set your browser to disable cookies, but some portions of this site (and other sites) may not work properly if you do this.
Information collected using pixel tags or clear GIFs. Textbooks.com may use "message format" and "message open" sensing technologies to help us understand the effectiveness of certain of our email marketing efforts. Both technologies require the use of pixel tags or clear GIFs (also called web beacons). The "message format" sensing technology allows us to recognize whether you have enabled your email program to receive HTML emails; if so, this information is then associated with your email address so that subsequent messages can be sent to you in HTML format. The "message open" sensing technology allows us to recognize whether you have opened our email message. We can only detect this if your have enabled your email program to receive HTML emails.
Site Optimization and Usage Tracking. In order to assure your visits to our websites are completely satisfactory, our system automatically identifies which browser you are using, the IP (Internet Provider) you used for access, and your Operating System. We do not collect any personal information from your hard drive. We also track user traffic patterns throughout our website. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our site users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas, as well as the kinds of products that most interest our customers. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue building a better site for you. To do this, we use web beacons and cookies (discussed below). We contract with third parties to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt out" of our ability to analyze such data by clicking the following link  and following the instructions provided.

How Is Your Personal Information Protected?
Textbooks.com maintains reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the Personal Information to protect against unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. To further secure your Personal Information:
We have instituted measures to help protect your Personal Information from being intercepted and read as it is transmitted over the Internet.
We cross check an email address with the submitted password to validate access to any Textbooks.com customer account.
We do not allow any email address to access more than one Textbooks.com account. When a new Textbooks.com account is created, we require you to submit an email address that is not associated with an existing Textbooks.com account.
We encourage you to use a password that is not easily determinable (e.g., don't use your name or street name). Keep your password secure; do not share it with anyone. The password is the "key" to your account; anyone who gets this "key" can, along with your email address, gain access to your account.
If you forget your password, go to the My Account log in page and click on the "Forgot your password?" link, and then type in the email address of the account you would like to open. A message will be sent to your email address with instructions on how to access your account and change your password.
If you want to change your password or other account information, simply log onto your account and follow the instructions.
We encourage you to remember to sign out. To further prevent unauthorized access to your account, remember that after you sign in, you should sign out once you have (i) completed your transaction, (ii) completed managing your account, or (iii) decided to step away from your computer. Anyone who accesses your computer after you have signed in but before you have either signed out or your session has timed-out can access your account.
In the event that your Personal Information is accessed and acquired by an unauthorized individual, we will conduct an investigation to determine if there is a reasonable possibility that your Personal Information has been, or will be, misused. In the event that we determine that misuse is reasonably possible, or that state or federal law requires that we issue a consumer notification, we will notify you of the unauthorized access unless a law enforcement agency believes that such notification may interfere with a criminal investigation. Notification of such an event may be given to you by e-mail, writing, or phone.
