State Bar of Texas | Privacy Policy
Privacy Statement
The goal of Texasbar.com is to provide a rich array of information and online tools to State Bar of Texas members and the public. To do this effectively, certain user data may be collected and/or reviewed so that we can understand our users and in turn make Texasbar.com more and more relevant to each individual user. Information about members and the public is used in different ways, as outlined below.
This privacy statement may change from time to time as we add features to Texasbar.com. If you have questions or comments, please contact John Sirman at john.sirman@texasbar.com.
Information Collected and its Use
Information collected from both members and the public includes:
Server log information: When you visit Texasbar.com or any other website, you are identifiable as a unique number, called an IP address. Your IP address is automatically collected in server logs. We use this information to help diagnose problems with our server and to analyze server traffic to learn which pages on Texasbar.com receive more or fewer visitors. This information is anonymous and cannot be traced back to a specific individual. The server log also can tell us which browser you are using (i.e. Internet Explorer or Netscape), and the name of the website that referred you to our site. (i.e., if you were visiting the Dallas Bar Association website and clicked on a link to Texasbar.com, you were "referred" through the Dallas Bar site).
Cookies: These are text files which our website places on your computer's hard drive to keep track of your preferences. We may use cookies to personalize your experience on Texasbar.com. That is, cookies may help us remember who you are and deliver content and services based on your personal preferences.
User-supplied information: Current and future services on Texasbar.com, may require that you give us your name, email address, or other personal information. By providing this information, you can and will be able to transact business via the Internet which in the past required telephone or mail contact with the State Bar. These online services are provided as a convenience to our members, and allow the State Bar to provide you with efficient and high-quality service at a lower cost.
Access to some services is protected by a password. We recommend that you not divulge your password to anyone.
Certain features of TexasBar.com allow attorneys to request updates to their membership information, including their address, telephone numbers, and email addresses. Attorneys should be aware that certain member information, regardless of whether it is submitted via TexasBar.com , is subject to the Texas Public Information Act. This act requires the State Bar to disclose this information upon request. Because of this requirement, this information may be obtained by commercial vendors. Attorneys can limit the information they provide to the State Bar Membership Department as long as the Bar has at least one address on file so that mandatory compliance materials can be mailed to and reach the attorney. An attorney may choose not to provide a home address, phone number, fax number, or email address. To contact the State Bar Membership Department, email memmail@texasbar.com or call (800)204-2222, Ext. 1383.
Security
We have security measures in place that are intended to prevent the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under our control.
