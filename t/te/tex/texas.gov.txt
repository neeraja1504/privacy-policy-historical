TexasOnline Accessibility & Site Policies
Accessibility
Statement of Purpose
The Department of Information Resources is committed to providing an accessible web presence that enables the public full access to Texas government information and services. The Department of Information Resources has identified disability as a barrier to Internet access. This policy addresses accessibility from a disability standpoint. The following barriers to Internet access may be addressed in forthcoming versions of this policy: geographic barriers, economic barriers, and language barriers. Understanding that government has a responsibility to provide service to all citizens and businesses in its jurisdiction, the Department of Information Resources will make reasonable efforts to accommodate all users.
In order to make the TexasOnline website accessible, the Department of Information Resources has chosen to comply with high accessibility standards in order to make the TexasOnline web site accessible to all who visit. This policy describes these accessibility standards and may be updated periodically. The current version was approved on July 9, 2004.
Origin
The TexasOnline Electronic Framework Project and the TexasOnline Division of the Department of Information Resources were established pursuant to Subchapter I of Chapter 2054, Texas Government Code and the authority of the Department of Information Resources.

TexasOnline Accessibility Policy / Disability Barriers
Some form of disability affects as much as twenty-three percent of the Texas population. These include but are not limited to hearing impairment, visual impairment and cognitive disorders.
The Department of Information Resources is committed to making TexasOnline accessible to all users. Reasonable efforts will be made to accommodate all users who utilize standards compliant web browsers as well as enabling software or assistive devices. We welcome comments on how to improve the site's accessibility for users with disabilities.
Standard for Compliance
To ensure TexasOnline.com is accessible to everyone regardless of ability, we keep abreast of current accessibility practices and conduct testing throughout development of the web site and successively when applying new technologies and techniques. Achieving verification of the web site’s conformance with Section 508 is by means of various automated testing tools, such as Cynthia Says and aDesigner. Furthermore, adjunctive reviews conducted by volunteers of independent organizations work to bring the accessibility of TexasOnline.com to a more practical level.
Additional Information
Additional information about accessibility programs in Texas is available from the Governor's Committee on People with Disabilities. The Committee serves as a central source of information on the abilities, rights, problems, and needs of the estimated 4 million Texans with disabilities. The Committee's web site has additional information about the history of Texans with disabilities, statistical material and resources to provide a clearer picture about the number of people with disabilities and accessibility programs in Texas.
