We use this information to establish individual accounts and provide the survey and focus group services.  In addition, Testers provide demographic information such as age, sex, and general location so that we may determine if the Tester is eligible to participate in surveys or focus groups that require Testers to meet a specific demographic profile.")?> Finally, we collect the survey or focus group information that you, the Tester, have participated in.

You can notify us at any time to remove your registration information from our database by emailing us at remove@testspin.com.  Upon termination of your account, we will not keep any personal records concerning you except as required by law.
**4. How Will TestSpin Use the Surveys or Focus Group Responses?  **
TestSpin will use responses and related data to generate reports and associated documents.  The information is then given to the Clients and stored in the Clients' password protected accounts.
**5. How Will TestSpin Use My Personally Identifying Information?  **
TestSpin will not release personally identifying information to anyone.  TestSpin only uses personally identifying information to conduct focus groups or send surveys to Testers on behalf of the Clients.  Once the Testers complete the survey or focus group, TestSpin delivers the survey or focus group information to the Surveyor.  TestSpin sends the survey or focus group information without disclosing any personally identifying information about its Testers. A Tester's Demographic information that a Surveyor may require is disclosed only in aggregate form.  In other words, individual demographic information is not disclosed.
TestSpin may identify a Tester using their zip code.  Many commonly used segmentation systems use Zip Code + Four Digits to classify buyers.  Many survey or focus group creators request respondents using these classifications.  Zip codes are NOT required for TestSpin's services; however, its inclusion will potentially expand the number of surveys or focus groups for which you are eligible.
TestSpin will not sell, distribute, publish or otherwise disclose your personally identifying information without your express permission.  However, if we believe you have breached the Terms of Agreement, especially with regard to publishing, transmitting, or distributing unlawful, pornographic, harmful, abusive, threatening, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hate oriented, racist or otherwise objectionable materials or content, we will report such conduct to the appropriate authorities, and in accordance with any laws, we will turn over any and all information, including personally identifying information, to appropriate persons or entities.
Testers should be aware that in responding to surveys or focus groups they may be disclosing personally identifying information to Clients. The security and privacy protections in place on this Site and through the Service do not cover this type of transfer or disclosure of personally identifying information. Testers responding to surveys or focus groups are solely responsible for the content of their responses.
**6. Changes to this Privacy Policy  **
TestSpin will publish on its website any changes to this policy prior to those changes taking effect. In addition, TestSpin will email users of the change.  As always, if you do not agree with TestSpin's privacy policy, you have the option of requesting that we delete your personally identifying information from the site.
