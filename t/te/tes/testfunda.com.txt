We offer secure pages to collect sensitive information on our order form, such as credit card information. We also use administrative, physical and technical precautions to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of personal information stored on our system.

Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or
Protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of TESTfunda or Enabilon Learning Pvt. Limited, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.
If we become involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users subscribed to a particular product, or the number of users registered on our website. Such information does not identify you individually.
We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers.

Unless otherwise prohibited, we may shorten the retention period for some types of data if needed to free up storage space.
