Privacy and Cookies Policy | General | Terms and Conditions | About us | Tesco Mobile
At Tesco Mobile, we’re working hard to serve shoppers a little better every day.  Looking after the personal data you share with us is a hugely important part of this.  We want you to be confident that your data is safe and secure with us, and understand how we use it to offer you a better and more personalised experience.
We are committed to doing the right thing when it comes to how we collect, use and protect your personal data.  That’s why we’ve developed this privacy policy (“Policy”), which –
Sets out the types of personal data that we collect;
Explains how and why we collect and use your personal data;
Details when and why we will share personal data;
Details when and why we will share personal data within the Tesco Goup and with third parties; and
Explains the rights and choices you have when it comes to your personal data.
What this Policy covers
The Data Controller is Tesco  Mobile Limited (collectively referred to as “we” or “us” in this Policy).
We offer different products and services, so we want you to be clear about what the Policy covers.  If you –
Shop with us over the phone, online or otherwise use any website ("our Website") or mobile applications ("our Mobile Apps") where this Policy is posted; or
Use our mobile communications network (the "Network")
(collectively known as “our Services”), then this Policy applies to you.  This Policy also applies if you contact us or interact with us with regard to our Services.
Some other parts of our business and other Tesco Group companies may need to collect and use personal data to provide you with their products and services and for certain other purposes.  They have their own privacy policies that explain how they use your personal data.
Our Website or Mobile Apps may contain links to other websites operated by third parties that have their own privacy policies.  Please make sure you read their terms and conditions and privacy policy carefully before you submit any personal data to a third party website as we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these third party websites.

So we can connect you to our Network, we need to know your location when you make or receive phone calls, messages or use the internet.

We also access Clubcard information from Tesco Stores and may access information where permissible from Tesco Bank.  We may take this information into account when assessing credit risk.
