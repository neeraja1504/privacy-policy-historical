Each time you visit one of our websites, your browser or Internet session automatically sends us certain types of non-personal information.

Definitions
Cookies
Data created by a web server that is stored on a user’s computer. It provides a way for the website to keep track of a user’s patterns and preferences and, with the cooperation of the Web browser, to store them on the user’s own hard disk. The cookies contain a range of URLs (Web addresses) for which they are valid. When the browser encounters those URLs again, it sends those specific cookies to the web server. You can avoid the use of cookies by having your browser disable cookies or warn you before accepting a cookie. Look for the cookie options in your browser in the Options or Preferences menu.
NOTE: If you disable cookies in your browser, you will not be able to access any of TestMasters’ secured websites.
IP (Internet Protocol) Address
This is the address of a computer attached to a TCP/IP network. Every client and server station must have a unique IP address. Client workstations have either a permanent address or one that is dynamically assigned for each dial-up session. IP addresses are written as four sets of numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.64.2).
Browser Session
A browser session is defined as the period of time a browser is in consecutive use. The session begins when you open the browser and ends when you close it. When you reopen the browser, you begin a new session.
TLS Encryption (Transport Layer Security)
TLS Encryption is the leading security protocol on the Internet. When an TLS session is started, the browser sends its public key to the server so that the server can securely send a secret key to the browser. The browser and server exchange data via secret key encryption during that session. We use TLS encryption during registration when you enter your credit card number or other personal information and during the creation of your login for the Online Resource Center when entering your social security number.

URLs are Internet addresses. URLs are used to locate sites on the Internet and to navigate between sites and pages within sites. The URL for TestMasters is www.testmasters.net.
