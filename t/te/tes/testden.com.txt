Security Measures
Our website has reasonable security measures in place to help protect personal information under our control.
Why We Use Cookies
When you visit some of our sites, we use cookies to keep track of your information. This small piece of program code resides on your computer and stores your contact information for all of our request information sites. We do this so you are not required to re-enter your contact information as you move from one site to another. In addition, some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by us and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. You can generally opt out of the use of cookies by having your browser disable cookies or warn you before accepting a cookie. Look for the cookie options in your browser in the Options or Preferences menu. However, please be aware that some areas of our website may not provide you with an acceptable user experience if you have disabled the use of cookies.
Log Files
TestDEN web servers retains information about our users through log files. This includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Clear GIFs
We and our third party advertising companies may employ a software technology called clear GIFs that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to monitor the online movements of users. The main difference between the two is that clear GIFs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear GIFs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information. Clear GIFs can work with existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same site or advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited "www.companyA.com", which uses an advertising company's clear GIF, the website or advertising company would match the clear GIF's identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information would then be given to the advertising company or site.
Links From Our Site To Other Sites
Some of our sites may contain links to other sites external to our sites. When you access these external websites, the providers of the sites will have access to certain information about you. TestDEN is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any websites which we do not directly control.
