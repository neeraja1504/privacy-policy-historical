We may use your personal data to tailor marketing to you
We do this so we can tell you about things we think you would like to know about.
We may send marketing by post, telephone, text, email and other electronic means.
We may also provide tailored marketing to you in other places, such as at the tills when you shop at Tesco.
We will only ever send you information about things we think are relevant to you.
Some tailored marketing needs your agreement, we will only send you this type of marketing with your permission.
Helping us understand more about you
Helping us understand more about you
Using your personal data to help us understand more about you
We may look at your Clubcard data in different ways; to help us understand more about you and people like you. We call this ‘profiling’. See the ‘How Tesco Bank and Clubcard work together’ section for more information.
When you take part in competitions, surveys or promotions we will collect and keep information such as your answers, feedback and contributions to questionnaires.
Combining different sources of data
Combining different sources of data
We may combine different sources of data we know about you
We may have data about you from several different sources – for example, from your Tesco Bank account, your Tesco Clubcard, and your visits to Tesco Group websites.
The personal data we get from your account can include data about your transactions and how you manage your account.
The personal data we get from your Tesco Clubcard can include data about your shopping habits and the types of things you buy.
The personal data we get from your visits to Tesco Group websites may include data you have given us when requesting a quote, even if you didn’t go on to take out a product with us.
Data from external sources
Data from external sources
We may sometimes get data from other external sources

Websites where you have an ‘account’ – such as Gmail or Facebook – will also have their own pages which explain their own information policies.
Offering tailored products
Offering tailored products
We may use personal data we know about you to offer you tailored products
We may use personal data we know about you to offer you products we think you might like.
When we do this, we might use data about how you manage your account or policy, including your credit history. We might also combine this with data we know about you from your Tesco Clubcard. Pre-approved offers are based on information we already know about you. When we make you a pre-approved offer, we do not do external credit checks.
We will only ever use your personal data in this way so that we can offer you better deals than you would get if we didn’t use that information.
Opting out of marketing
Opting out of marketing
You can opt out of us using your personal data for marketing at any time
We consider that our marketing and profiling activities can be to our mutual benefit as it helps us to ensure that we only tell you about products and services that we believe will be of interest to you.
It is in our legitimate interests to ensure we carry out marketing in the most effective way, although we will always ensure that we carry out any direct marketing in line with your marketing preferences. Plus, there will always be an option for you to opt out or say no to us using your personal data for marketing during any application process for our products or services.
To opt out, just let us know in one of these ways
On emails - by clicking ‘opt out’ or ‘unsubscribe’ (usually at the bottom of the email).
Online - by logging in to your Tesco Bank accounts and going to ‘Account Overview > Your marketing preferences’.
By phone - by calling us (all our numbers are listed at www.tescobank.com/help/contact-us).
Using data to bring you better offers
Using data to bring you better offers
We use Tesco Bank and Clubcard data together to bring you better offers
Clubcard data includes your shopping habits and the types of purchases you or your household make.
We use Tesco Bank and Clubcard data together in different ways to tailor our communications and to try to bring you better terms, deals or offers than you would get if we didn’t use the information.
Matching clubcards at your address
Matching clubcards at your address
We try and match you with Clubcards at your address
We use data that you provide, such as your name and address, to find any Clubcard(s) that are linked to your address. That might be your Clubcard, the Clubcard of other family member(s), or the Clubcard of house or flatmates.
We may use data about these Clubcard(s) to help us work out what offers we think you might like. When we do this, we will only ever use the Clubcard linked to your address which gives you the best terms, deals or offers.
Using Clubcard data for offers
Using Clubcard data for offers
We use your Clubcard data to help us work out offers
We do this by looking at your Clubcard data in different ways to help us understand more about you (we call this ‘profiling’). Profiling includes things such as how likely we think you are to pay back money we lend you, how often you use other Tesco products and services, and how you prefer to shop. Profiling helps us to create a number of ‘Clubcard scores’, which we can then use as one of the factors in our automated decision-making process.
Where applicable, at the point of applying, individual offers you receive may be affected by your credit rating. We may also take into account whether or not you are a Clubcard customer.
Profiling allows us to tailor offers specifically for you. This means that different Clubcard customers may get different offers. Where we do use profiling, those customers will receive better offers and/ or be more likely to be accepted for the product requested than non-Clubcard customers who have a broadly equivalent credit rating.
Calculating your 'Clubcard score'
Calculating your 'Clubcard score'
We may calculate a new ‘Clubcard score’ for you when your policy changes
We may calculate a new ‘Clubcard score’ when we give you a quote, or offer you a renewal. We do this so we can make you, as a Clubcard customer, better and/or more tailored offers.

Your Tesco Bank card is also a Clubcard
Your Tesco Bank card is also a Clubcard
Your Tesco Bank card is also a Clubcard
Your Tesco Bank credit/debit card is also a Clubcard. This means we will need to share information with Tesco which is to do with operating your Clubcard (for example, for allocating points, working out discounts, or where you have agreed to receive marketing). When we do this we do not share any more information than we need to.
Clubcards are managed separately.
Why we share your personal data
Why we share your personal data
Why we share your personal data
In order to provide our products and services to you, it is necessary for us to share information with third parties. For some third parties we need to share your personal data because they provide a service which we do not provide (such as the Insurers or the Add-on Providers). For other third parties, we are required to share your personal data to detect and prevent fraud and other forms of financial crime, to ensure that we are lending responsibly or to ensure that we are meeting our regulatory requirements.

Credit decisioning
Credit decisioning
What credit decisioning is, and how it works
When someone borrows money from a bank, there is always a risk that they may not be able to pay it back. Credit decisioning, which involves credit scoring and checking if you are able to afford the lending, is a way of working out how likely we think it is that you will pay back the money we lend you. Your credit score, which is part of your assessment, is worked out automatically by a computer. It takes into account different factors, such as the amount of debt you currently have, how you have paid off debts in the past and, where relevant, information from your Clubcard.
Credit decisioning and credit scoring are important steps in making sure we are lending responsibly.
The sources of data we use for your credit score
We use four main sources of data when working out your credit score:
the personal data you give us in your application
data we get from third parties, such as credit reference agencies
information we already know about you in connection with other Tesco Bank products, and
sometimes, information from the wider Tesco Group, including Clubcard transactions
Credit reference agencies
Credit reference agencies
How we use credit reference agencies
When we are processing your application for a product or service, we will perform credit and identity checks with one or more credit reference agency.
To do this, we will supply your personal data to the credit reference agencies and they will give us data about you. This will include information from your application about your financial situation and financial history.
Credit reference agencies will give us information that is public, such as information from the electoral register, as well as specific information they know, such as shared credit, financial situation and financial history information, and fraud prevention information.
When we use credit reference agencies
We run checks when you apply. If you are with Tesco Bank, we will also do periodic checks while you are using our products or services (the number and frequency of these checks will depend on which products or services you have).
Sharing your personal data with credit reference agencies
We will also regularly share data about how you manage your account with credit reference agencies so they can keep their records accurate and up-to-date.
What we do with information from credit reference agencies
We use data from credit reference agencies to:
assess your creditworthiness and whether we think you can afford to take the product
check the personal data you have given us is accurate
prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering
help to manage and make decisions about your account(s)
trace and recover debts
make sure any offers we make to you are appropriate to your circumstances
Ongoing exchange of information with credit reference agencies
We will continue to exchange data about you with credit reference agencies while you have a relationship with us. This includes telling the credit reference agencies how you manage your debts; for example, how you repay your loans, credit card, mortgages or manage your overdraft.
If you do not pay back in full or on time, we will tell the credit reference agencies and they will record the outstanding debt.
Other organisations will be able to see this information.
Credit reference agencies keep a record of search requests we make
When we make a search request, the credit reference agencies may make a note on your file that Tesco Bank has done a search. Other organisations will be able to see that Tesco Bank made a search of your data.
Joint applications, additional cards holders, financial associates and credit reference agencies
If you are making a joint application, or tell us that you have a spouse or partner or anyone else that you are financially associated with (for example, if you have a joint mortgage with a friend or family member), we will also search their information with the credit reference agencies and link your records together.
Credit reference agencies will also link your records together. Your records will stay linked until either you or the other person requests that the files are no longer linked (this is known as issuing a ‘notice of disassociation’). It is important that anybody you are making a joint application with, or any financial associate you tell us about, understands this before you make an application.
For more information about credit reference agencies
The three main credit reference agencies are TransUnion, Equifax and Experian.
To learn more about what they do, what information they hold, and what your rights are, go to their websites below:
Fraud and financial crime prevention agencies
Fraud and financial crime prevention agencies
Fraud and financial crime prevention agencies
Before we provide you with goods, services, or financing, we provide data to and make checks with fraud and financial crime prevention agencies. To do this, we need to use and collect personal data about you.
We will also continue to share information with fraud and financial crime prevention agencies while you have a relationship with us.
We provide this information because it is essential for us to verify your identity, prevent fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption, and not transact with individuals subject to UK and international sanctions. The law and regulations say we must do this to protect our business, consumers and the industry.
These checks are a contractual requirement of our products and services. That means if you want to take out one of our products or services you must agree to them.
To make these checks, we will use both data you have given us and data we get from third parties. Types of data we typically use for fraud and financial crime prevention, as well as other mandatory compliance purposes, are:
name, address, date of birth
contact details
nationality
financial information
employment details
data we know about your digital devices (for example, your IP address)
We might allow law enforcement agencies to access your personal data
We, and fraud and financial crime prevention agencies, may also allow the police and other law enforcement agencies to access and use the personal data we know about you. They do this to detect, investigate and prevent crime.
How long do fraud and financial crime prevention agencies hold your personal data?
Fraud and financial crime prevention agencies hold personal data for different periods of time.
If they think that someone poses a fraud or other financial crime risk, they can hold that personal data for up to six years.
What happens if we think you are a fraud or financial crime risk, or do not have a right to UK residency
If we, or a fraud or financial crime prevention agency, think that you pose a fraud or financial crime risk, or do not have a right to UK residency, then we may refuse to provide the services you have applied for, or we may stop providing existing services to you.
Fraud and financial crime prevention agencies will keep a record of the fact that we think you pose a risk.
In some cases, these records can be seen by others, and might result in other organisations refusing to provide services, financing or employment.
If you have any questions about this or want to find out which fraud prevention agencies we use, you can contact us by using the contact number for your product.
Fraud and financial crime prevention and automated decision-making
We may use computers to automatically run fraud and money-laundering checks without involving a person in running those checks. This is known as ‘automated decision-making’. These automated checks look for unusual activity, which helps us to decide:
whether someone might pose a fraud or financial crime risk
whether someone has the right to UK residency
whether their behaviour is compatible with known fraud or other types of financial crime is inconsistent with information we already have about them
if we think they are hiding their true identity
For more information about automated decision-making
You have rights relating to automated decision-making.
Sending your personal data outside of the European Economic Area
If fraud or financial crime prevention agencies need to send your personal data outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), then the organisations they send it to are contractually obliged to protect your personal data to the same standards as in the EEA.
Fraud and financial crime prevention agencies may alternatively need to agree to other international frameworks for secure data sharing.

Fraud prevention and industry data sharing
Fraud prevention and industry data sharing
Fraud and financial crime prevention, credit reference agencies and industry data sharing
Before we can provide you with insurance, we may need to get data about you, all drivers named on the policy, and anyone who is paying your premiums.
We may get this information from third parties such as credit reference agencies, fraud and financial crime prevention agencies, and other agencies that have been set up for that purpose. The information they give us can include publicly available information, information from the electoral register, and other information they have derived from previous searches.
When we contact these agencies, they may make a record that we have asked for information. This will not affect your credit rating.
Times when we may need to get information include:
to verify your identity
to establish your right to UK residency
to assess if a product is suitable for you
to check what terms of cover we should offer
to assess your creditworthiness
to process claims
to manage and maintain your policy
when you renew
to trace and recover debts
to prevent criminal activity, such as fraud and other forms of financial crime
We may also check your personal data with other organisations
We may also check you, all named drivers and anyone who is paying your premiums with other organisations such as:
the DVLA
the Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE), run by MIB Management Services Limited (MSL)
the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, run by the Association of British Insurers (ABI)
we may also check with other similar organisations
We may share information we hold about you with others
We may share information you have given to us so we can check it is correct, and to help detect and prevent crime, including fraud and money laundering. The times when we may do this are:
when you apply for insurance (or a subsequent variation to cover)
while maintaining your policy
when renewing your policy
when you make a claim
Agencies will keep a record of our enquiries
A record of our search will be left on your file at the credit reference agency. This record may be visible to other lenders when they carry out checks in the future.
This will not affect your credit rating.
How to get more information about the Claims and Underwriting Exchange
Fraud and financial crime prevention agencies
Fraud and financial crime prevention agencies
We might collect information from other publicly available sources, such as social media
We and our panel insurers may research, collect and use data from publicly available sources. We do this to help detect and prevent fraud and other forms of financial crime. If you are not sure what information you have made available to the public on social media, we recommend that you visit the privacy settings on each of your social media accounts.
What happens if we suspect fraud or other forms of financial crime?
If you give inaccurate details, we suspect fraud or other financial crime, or we suspect that you do not have the right to UK residency, we will share this information with other organisations.
They may use this information when making decisions about you and others in your household. This may include decisions about whether to lend you money, offer you insurance, as well as other decisions about tracing debt and detecting crime.
You must tell us about any incident, whether or not you think it is likely to give rise to a claim
It is a condition of your policy that you tell us about any incidents.
When you tell us about an incident, we will pass this information on to the registers mentioned above.
Fraud and financial crime prevention agencies
We provide this information because it is essential for us to verify your identity and to prevent fraud and other forms of financial crime. The law and regulations say we must do this to protect our business, consumers and the industry.
These checks are a contractual requirement of our products and services. That means if you want to take out one of our products or services, you must agree to them.
To make these checks, we will use both data you have given us, and data we get from third parties. Types of information we typically use for fraud prevention are:
name, address, date of birth
nationality
contact details
financial information
employment details
data we know about your digital devices (for example, your IP address)
vehicle details
claims history
We might allow law enforcement agencies to access your personal data
We, and fraud and financial crime prevention agencies, may also allow law enforcement agencies to access and use the personal data we know about you. They do this where they believe that it is absolutely necessary to detect, investigate and prevent crime.
How long do fraud and financial crime prevention agencies hold your personal data?
Fraud and financial crime prevention agencies hold personal data for different periods of time.
If they think that someone poses a fraud or other financial crime risk, they can hold that personal data for up to six years.
What happens if we suspect fraud other forms of financial crime, you give inaccurate information or do not have the right to UK residency?
If we, or a fraud or financial crime prevention agency, think that you pose a fraud or other financial crime risk, or if we think you have given inaccurate information, or do not have the right to UK residency, we may:
refuse to provide the services you have applied for
stop providing existing services to you
We will keep a record of any fraud or other financial crime risk
Both we and fraud and financial crime prevention agencies will keep a record of any fraud or other financial crime risk.
This may result in others refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you. If you have any questions about this or want to find out which fraud prevention agencies we use, you can contact us by using the contact number for your product.
Fraud and financial crime prevention and automated decision-making
We may use computers to automatically run fraud and other financial crime checks without involving a person in running those checks. This is known as ‘automated decision-making’. These automated checks look for unusual activity, which helps us to decide:
whether someone might pose a fraud or money-laundering risk
whether someone has the right to UK residency
whether their behaviour is consistent with or similar to known fraud or other financial crime methodologies
is inconsistent with information we already have about them
if we think they are hiding their true identity
For more information about automated decision-making
You have rights relating to automated decision-making.
Sending your personal data outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”)
If fraud prevention agencies need to send your personal data outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), then the organisations they send it to are contractually obliged to protect your personal data to the same standards as in the EEA.
Fraud prevention agencies may alternatively need to agree to other international frameworks for secure data sharing.
Sensitive personal data
Sensitive personal data
When we need to use sensitive personal data
Sometimes we will need to ask you for sensitive personal data. For example, when dealing with an insurance policy, you might need to tell us about a medical condition. If required, to comply with data protection laws, we will ask for your explicit consent to use this data (data protection laws call this ‘special category data’ or ‘sensitive personal data’).
Special circumstances
Special circumstances
How we handle data about special circumstances
We handle data about any special circumstances as carefully and confidentially as any other data we hold about you. This includes data about things you tell us so that we are able to provide you with additional assistance (e.g. if you are hard of hearing) and also information that laws or regulations say we must record (for example, if any underlying medical condition has led to you appointing a Power of Attorney).
Contacting you
Contacting you
How we will contact you
We may contact you by phone/post/email and SMS. If you have given us an email address or mobile number, we might also use these to contact you with servicing messages about your application or account (for example, to keep you updated about how your application is going) and for ongoing account management.
Confidential Data
Confidential Data
We keep confidential data to a minimum via email and text
This is because emails and texts are less secure (you should never send us any confidential data via email or text).
Sending personal data outside the EEA
Sending personal data outside the EEA
We will only send your personal data outside the EEA if we know it will be well protected
Sometimes we might send your personal data to another country if, for example, our service provider has a data centre overseas.
All countries within the EEA have broadly the same data protection laws. Before sending your personal data outside the EEA, we check that the recipient will be able to keep your personal data secure and that:
the EU Commission confirms that the recipient is established in a country which offers essentially equivalent protection to that provided within the EEA; or
it is to a private US company that has self-certified with the Privacy Shield
If neither of these apply, then we ask the recipient to sign the EU Commission’s ‘model contract’. This means they must meet EU standards of data protection.
When your personal data is in another country, it may be accessed by law enforcement agencies in those countries. They do this to detect and prevent crime, or because the law says they must. For more information about sending your personal data overseas, you can write to: The Data Protection Officer, Tesco Bank, PO BOX 27009, Glasgow, G2 9EZ.
Keeping your personal data
Keeping your personal data
We keep your personal data for a reasonable period only
How long we keep your personal data will depend on:
what type of product or service we are providing for you
how long laws or regulations say we must

Your Rights
Your Rights
You have the right to know what data we hold about you
This is called your ‘subject access right’.
The law says that you are entitled to see what data we hold about you
If you ask us for this, we will give you access or send you a copy of all the personal data we hold about you (there are a few exceptions to this, such as access to personal data about third parties). If you want a copy of your personal data, please use the subject access form.
__
We will respond to your request within one month.
We may get in touch sooner if we need extra information to help us find your personal data, or to verify your identity.
Information about insurance claims is held by the Tesco Bank Providers
If you want to see what data the Tesco Bank Providers hold, you need to contact them directly. The Tesco Bank Providers for your policy will be confirmed on your policy schedule.
You have the right to have the personal data you have provided to us supplied to you in an easily transferable digital format
This is known as the ‘right to data portability’.
This means you can ask us to send your personal data in this format to you, or to another organisation (for example, another bank or insurer).
You have the right to change or amend your personal data
If you think any of the personal data we hold about you is incorrect or incomplete, let us know and we will change it.
You have the right to stop us using, restrict us using, or request that we erase the personal data we hold about you
If you want us to stop using, or restrict our use of, your personal data, or you want us to erase it entirely, please let us know. There are times when we may not be able to do this – for example, if the information is related to an existing or recently expired contract between you and us, or if the law says we need to keep your personal data for a certain amount of time.
You have rights in respect of automated decision making (including profiling)
An automated decision is one that is made by our systems rather than by a person and we use these to perform automatic checks. This helps us make lending decisions, work out what products and services we can offer you, how much to charge for some products and services and helps to prevent fraud. Automated decision-making helps us to decide things like how likely it is that someone will pay back the money they owe us. It takes into account factors such as the amount of debt someone has, and how they have paid off debts in the past etc. The benefit of automated decision making is that we can quickly make key decisions.
You have the right to:
Express your concerns and object to a decision taken by purely automated means
To request that a person reviews that decision
You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time
Sometimes we need your consent to process your personal data. If you have given consent, you can change your mind and withdraw it. To do this, get in touch by using the relevant contact details from our website.
However, we do not always need your consent to use your personal data. There is some information this doesn’t apply to. For instance;
the information we need in order to provide your product or service
the information that it’s necessary we have in order to run our business or to provide the products or services in a more effective way (known as the “legitimate interests” condition), or
the information the law says we must collect and use
