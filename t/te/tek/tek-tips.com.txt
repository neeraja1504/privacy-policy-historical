Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify you, including, but not limited to, your first and last name, your home or work address and an email address or other contact information. We have designed engineering.com's web pages in such a way that you can visit most public areas without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.
Engineering.com strives to comply with relevant privacy legislation around the world. Our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information regardless of where that Personal Information is collected or stored.

Tracking your subscriber information
We collect Personal Information supplied by our users who register or who choose to provide their profile data to access certain areas or information on engineering.com. This profile data allows us to better match our content to the needs of our audience. For example, if your engineering specialty is “mechanical” you will be more likely to be presented with content that is specifically aimed at mechanical engineers. Engineering.com is a free service that is supported by advertising, so we also use this data to better match advertisements and promotions to our audience.
Choice
You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to engineering.com. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of engineering.com's Web pages, but you may be unable to access certain pages and the services that they contain.

To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, engineering.com wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information.

Sharing of Data with Third Parties
Third parties provide certain services, such as email list maintenance, available on engineering.com or on our behalf. Engineering.com may provide information, including Personal Information, that engineering.com collects to third-party service providers to help us deliver programs, products, information, and services. Engineering.com will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service providers are obligated to protect Personal Information on engineering.com's behalf.
If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information, we may transfer that Information within engineering.com, to engineering.com's third-party service providers as required, and to advertisers whose information you have viewed or downloaded.

Other than as stated herein, engineering.com does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on engineering.com's behalf unless such transfer is legally required.
