Tektronix Privacy Policy | Tektronix
At Tektronix, we offer measurement solutions that enable your breakthrough innovations. Our shared success depends on a solid understanding of your needs. One way we pursue this understanding is by collecting information about you when you use our products or otherwise interact with us. When you share your information with us, you entrust us with your privacy, and that is a responsibility we take seriously.
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, transfer and otherwise process information about you. (In this document, “we”—along with “our” and “us”—refers collectively to Tektronix, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, acting as a data controller for the purposes of applicable data collection law.) The policy applies to information collected about you when you use our software, devices, websites, and mobile applications, and other online products and services we provide (collectively, the “Products”), or when you otherwise interact with us.
The information we collect falls into two broad categories:
Personal information includes personal identifiers, such as your name, your email address, your credit card number, or the serial number of the Tektronix product you are using. All information that is actively linked to one or more personal identifiers is also considered personal information.
Anonymized information refers to any information that is not actively linked to one or more personal identifiers. This information is often most useful to us in the aggregate, allowing us to monitor market acceptance of new product features, for example.
Using anonymized information where possible is one manner in which we protect your privacy. The remainder of this document addresses our policy when we collect, use, disclose, transfer or otherwise process your personal information.
Where we need your consent to collect, use, disclose, transfer or otherwise process your personal information (as described in this Privacy Policy), you provide such consent by accessing and using the Products. If you do not consent to such processing, then do not further access or use the Products.
Privacy laws vary from country to country. Sometimes the law requires express consent to collect certain personal information, such as your location; or to use personal information for a certain purpose, such as direct marketing. Where we need express consent to a particular form of processing, we obtain such consent in the manner described in this Privacy Policy or a country-specific appendix to it, or as otherwise required by law.
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we notify you by revising the “Last Updated” date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to our homepage or by emailing you a notification). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy whenever you access the Products to stay informed about our information handling practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. After we have notified you of changes to this Privacy Policy, your continued use of the Products constitutes your consent to those changes.
