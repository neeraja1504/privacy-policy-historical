Privacy Policy | Capgemini Worldwide
Capgemini believes that the establishment of trust and privacy is instrumental to the continued growth of the Internet.  We also believe that the efficient collection, use and transfer of information serve to enhance the development of the Internet and electronic commerce, provided that such information is handled in a fair and responsible manner.
Introduction
In order to inform you of its policies and activities with respect to the collection, use and transfer of Personal Data on its websites, Capgemini is providing you with an electronic copy of this Privacy Policy (the “ Policy ”). This Policy applies to all websites that are owned and operated by Cap Gemini S.A. and/or companies that Cap Gemini S.A. controls, directly or indirectly (collectively, “ Capgemini ”), unless a particular website displays its own privacy policy.
Cap Gemini S.A. or one of companies that Cap Gemini S.A. controls, directly or indirectly, is the data controller with respect to Personal Data collected and processed via its respective website. When required by local law, the relevant Capgemini entity performs the formalities with the local data protection authorities with respect to the processing of Personal Data.
In this Policy, “Personal Data” means information which relates to an individual and which identifies that individual, either directly or indirectly (together with other information that is reasonably likely to come into Capgemini’s possession), such as your name, email address or telephone number.

Generally, you can visit Capgemini websites without providing any Personal Data about yourself. However, in order to access some parts of our websites, such as to download certain documents, or in connection with another specific purpose, we may need to collect Personal Data from you.  Providing Personal Data to us in these events is voluntary.  If you do not provide Personal Data to us, then you will not be able to benefit from the respective functionality offered by our websites, such as communication, downloading of documents or recruitment.

D. "Do-not-track" signals
Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the browser communicates.  As of the Effective Date of this Privacy Policy, an industry standard has not yet been established on how to respond to these signals.

Global organization
Capgemini is a global organization. Whilst we have distinct legal entities (e.g., country subsidiaries) in many parts of the world, our internal processes and infrastructure are international in scope and nature and generally cross country borders. Accordingly, you should be aware that we may share your Personal Data inside Capgemini and transfer it to countries in the world where we have data centers or otherwise do business, including those located outside the European Union (EU). In these instances, Capgemini will process your Personal Data in the manner described by this Policy and in accordance with applicable law.
Capgemini is taking into account the invalidation by the Court of Justice of the European Union of the Safe Harbor program for its personal data transfers to the United States. The impact of this decision on Capgemini is limited since none of the US Capgemini entities is Safe Harbor certified (other than IGATE). For personal data transfers from its EU to its US entities, Capgemini signs EU Standard Model Clauses.
Third-party suppliers
Like many organizations, we use third-party suppliers to collect, use and otherwise process Personal Data on our behalf. Our practice is to require such third parties to handle Personal Data in accordance with Capgemini’s Privacy Policy.
After the Safe Harbor invalidation by the Court of Justice of the European Union, Capgemini is asking its US third-party suppliers to sign the EU Standard Model Clauses.
Business reorganizations
Like many organizations, Capgemini may reorganize its business operations around the world from time to time, whether by buying new businesses or selling or merging existing businesses. This may involve us disclosing Personal Data to prospective or actual purchasers of parts of our business, or receiving Personal Data from potential sellers.  It is our practice to seek appropriate confidentiality protection for Personal Data disclosed in these types of transactions.
Legal disclosures
Capgemini may disclose your Personal Data in order to enforce our website Terms of Use or in urgent circumstances to protect personal safety, the public or Capgemini’s websites. It is also possible that we may be required by law to disclose your Personal Data pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders, potentially, in any country where we do business.
Sensitive Personal Data
As a general rule, Capgemini does not collect “Sensitive Personal Data” through its website. “Sensitive Personal Data” means Personal Data concerning racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, or concerning health or sex life. By volunteering unsolicited sensitive Personal Data to us (e.g., by submitting your resume or a job application online), you expressly consent to your Personal Data being used as described in this Policy.
Requests regarding your Personal Data: access, correction, update and deletion
Subject to applicable law and certain exemptions, you may have the right to access, rectify, oppose the processing, or delete your Personal Data.
In order to exercise these rights so that updates, corrections and/or deletions can be made in accordance with applicable law, you can:
either correct or delete your profile on our website;
or complete and submit this Personal Data request form.
Data security and integrity
Capgemini uses various technological and procedural security measures in order to protect the Personal Data we collect, use or transfer from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. However, you should be aware that, due to the open and unsecured character of the Internet, Capgemini cannot be responsible for the security of transmissions of the Personal Data over the Internet.
Third-party websites
Capgemini websites may provide links to third-party websites. Capgemini does not make any representations or warranties with respect to such third-party websites. You should be aware that the owners and operators of such third-party websites might collect, use or transfer Personal Data under different terms and conditions than Capgemini. Upon linking to a third-party website, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies of such third-party websites.
Notification of changes to this Policy
This Policy is effective in August 2014 (the “ Effective Date ”). In order to check updates to this Policy, please consult this page on a regular basis.
