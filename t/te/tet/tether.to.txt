When you provide sensitive information such as credit card details, it will be automatically converted into codes before being securely dispatched over the Internet.
Our web servers are protected behind “firewalls” and our systems are monitored to prevent any unauthorized access. All practical steps will be taken to ensure that personal data will not be kept longer than necessary.
Security Assurance
Both you and TETHER play an important role in protecting against online fraud.

Do not share your Username and/or password or allow access or use of it by others. We endeavor to put in place high standards of security to protect your interests.
You should safeguard your unique Username and Password by keeping it secret and confidential. Never write them down or share these details with anyone. When choosing your unique Username and Password for the first time, do not create it using easily identifiable information such as your birthday, telephone number or a recognizable part of your name.
