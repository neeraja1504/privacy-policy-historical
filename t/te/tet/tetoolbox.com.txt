We may disclose your personal information to third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf.

The information that cookies collect includes the date and time of your visit, your registration information, session identification number and your navigational history and preferences.
Cookies offer you many conveniences. They allow us to identify registered users when they return to the site. Cookies also save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information.
In some cases, our third-party service providers may use cookies on our sites. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by trck.me only, and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of our sites and services that depend on cookies but you will be able to perform basic navigation through the site.
In addition to cookies, we may use other technologies, including single-pixel gifs (also known as web beacons) on our websites and in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters.

Security of Your Personal Information
The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to help protect your personal information including without limitation:
limiting access to your personal information to those of our employees who require it to provide services to you;

ensuring that third-party service providers sign confidentiality agreements to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information and not to use it for any unauthorized purposes;
encrypting credit card information on our order forms using secure socket layer (SSL) technology; and
storing your personal information in secure computer systems which protect it from unauthorized access or use.

**Forums & Other Interactive Services **
Our sites may include discussion forums or other interactive areas or services, including blogs, chat rooms, bulletin boards, message boards, online hosting or storage services, or other areas or services in which you or third parties create, post or store any content, messages, comments, materials or other items on the sites ("Interactive Areas").

Interactive Area postings may be retained indefinitely. If at any time you would like to remove a posting, please email us at http://timtechsupport.com. Keep in mind that removal of a posting from an Interactive Area does not mean that the posting will be deleted from our systems.
Email Referrals
If you choose to use our email referral services to tell a friend about our products or services, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will use that information to send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site and review the product or service you have selected.
