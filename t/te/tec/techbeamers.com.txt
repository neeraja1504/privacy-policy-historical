What personal data we collect and why we collect it
Comments
We don’t have comments enabled on this site. However, there are old comments which could be visible to the public. We also not have the Gravatar service linked and hence can’t show your profile photo in the context of any of your previous comment.
Media
We never upload an image with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Hence, visitors to the website won’t be able to extract any location data from the pictures. Also, we don’t allow anyone apart from the authors to upload images.
Contact forms
If you use our contact form for communication, then you leave your email address for us to contact you back. We remove such emails from time to time. However, you may contact us to delete any of your previous conversations permanently.
Cookies
Neither we have commenting enabled nor do we allow registration or any personal login. So we don’t create any cookie intended for these purposes.
However, we use third-party advertisements from networks like Google AdSense to support our site. They may introduce cookies to supply relevant ads while you are browsing pages.
Content linking to other websites
Articles on this site may include links to other websites to improve user experience or supplement our content.

Analytics
We use Google Analytics to measure and track the visits to our website. Google Analytics enables a policy to remove the tracking data on a periodic basis, and we comply with it.
Who we share your data with
Neither we ask for any specific information from you nor do we share anything. It’s when you use our contact form and provide your email to seek our response. We remove such data from time to time, and you can also ask us to do the same.
