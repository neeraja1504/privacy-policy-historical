About Our Site
Tech.co (" our site ") is an online resource for technology and related news and information.
About Us
TechCo is a brand of Marketing VF Limited (" MVF ", " we ", " us ", " our ").
MVF is a company registered in England and Wales (company number: 06951544), whose registered office address is at Imperial Works, Perren Street, London NW5 3ED, United Kingdom.
For the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (the " GDPR "), Marketing VF Limited is the controller in relation to your data. We are registered as a controller with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) under registration number Z1995728. You can confirm our registration here: www.ico.org.uk
What Data We Collect, And How We Use It
Subscribing to our newsletters:
You can subscribe to our newsletters by completing and submitting the webform on our site. The webform will ask you for your first name, last name, email address, and newsletter preferences.
If you subscribe, we will send our newsletters to you periodically. At any time, you can unsubscribe by following the link in the newsletter.
Contacting us:
We will receive information about you if you contact us through our site, or by email or post. For example, to enquire about working with us, or with a news or press enquiry.
If you contact us, we will use your information to handle your enquiry and correspond with you.
Working with suppliers:
We work with a number of suppliers, who process data on our behalf. These include cloud storage providers, email service providers, and cloud telephony providers. We have appropriate contracts in place with such suppliers to ensure the protection and confidentiality of data.
To run our competitions and prize draws:
If you enter a competition or prize draw on our site, we will use the information that you provide to run the competition or prize draw, or contact you regarding your entry.
Where we are running a competition or prize draw jointly with another party, or promoting one of behalf of another party, we may share your entry details with that party, but only for the purposes of managing the competition or prize draw.
Requesting Quotes
Some of the webforms on our site allow you to request quotes or information for different products and services (" Quotes ").
What data we collect and how
If you complete our webform in order to request Quotes, it will ask you for your contact details, such as your name, company name, email address, telephone number, and postal address. Our webform will also ask you for information regarding your product/service requirements.
From time to time, we change our webforms, and so they may ask you for other information. It will always be clear from the webform what information we’re requesting, and we only request information that is relevant to your request, and the service that we’re providing.
We also store and share Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, as explained below. Every computer or device has an IP address – a unique number – which enables it to communicate with other computers and devices over the Internet.
If we call you to confirm your details or requirements, we may ask you for some additional information.
We may monitor and/or record these calls for the purposes of quality control and staff training. Also, occasionally, we may need to provide Suppliers (as explained below) with limited access to such recordings in order to resolve queries and disputes.
How we use your data
To connect you with relevant Suppliers
As explained above, if you submit our webform, we’ll pass your request to one or more relevant product or service suppliers (named on the webform) ("Suppliers"). We will do this in a secure way. For example, using HTTP Secure (HTTPS), which means the data is encrypted. The Suppliers then contact you directly with your quotes. They may contact you by telephone, text/SMS or email.
Before we pass your request to any Suppliers, our service may involve an element of automated decision-making. Our technology platform may automatically assess your product/service requirements and pass your request to such Suppliers that would like to receive requests for Quotes at the time your request is made.
We store IP addresses in order to stop unwanted traffic (i.e. spam) to our site. For example, if we become aware that spam is coming from a particular IP address (i.e. computer or location), we can block that IP address. From time to time, we also share IP addresses with Suppliers to enable Suppliers to verify that requests for Quotes have come from a particular country.
To call you to confirm your details or requirements
For certain products/services, before connecting you with relevant Suppliers, we may call you to confirm your details or requirements.
We may also call you to ask about your experience using our site and service, and dealing with the Suppliers with which we connected you.
Withdrawing your consent - If, at any time, you wish to withdraw your consent to be contacted by us or the Suppliers regarding your request for Quotes, you can exercise this right by accessing our preference centre https://preferences.safe-click.net.
To email you about similar products and services – But only if you haven’t opted out of such emails
If you use our quote request service, then, as an existing user, we would like to email you, or send you text/SMS messages, about similar products and services for which we think you might like quotes or information (" Other Products ").
You will always be given an opportunity to opt out of such messages before we send them, and we will not send such messages if you have opted out.
To create custom and lookalike/similar audiences
We like to work with Facebook, Google and other platforms (" Platforms ") to reach out to you with adverts for Other Products. We also like to use Platforms to reach out to other people who might like to use our quote request service.
We do this in two ways. In both cases, your data, along with other data, is used to create a custom audience and/or a lookalike/similar audience. Whenever an audience is shared with a Platform, the data is first hashed and pseudonymised, meaning that any data within the audience that could identify a person is replaced with an artificial identifier. So, the process is secure. Also, we don’t share more data than we need to for the purpose of creating the audience.
Custom audience – A custom audience is a list of existing users of our service (" Existing Users "). From time to time, we share this with Platforms. As explained above, the data is first hashed and pseudonymised. The Platform uses this audience to show our Existing Users our adverts for Other Products.
Lookalike/similar audience – A lookalike/similar audience is an audience created by the Platform. From time to time, we share with Platforms a list of Existing Users. The Platform uses this list to find and create lookalikes – i.e. other Platform users who have similar characteristics to the Existing Users – to which it shows our adverts. Again, as explained above, the data is first hashed and pseudonymised.
As we explain below, at any time, you may object to such activity by emailing us at dataprotection@mvfglobal.com.
Receiving data from Suppliers
From time to time, Suppliers may return data to us. They may do this if they have a query regarding a request for Quotes that we have sent to them in order to enable us to resolve the query. They may also return data to us, together with confirmation on whether or not a product has been purchased, in order to enable us to improve our marketing. We may also use such data to create custom and lookalike/similar audiences, as explained above.
Cookies
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. At the bottom of this policy, we have included a table, setting out what cookies we use, and the purposes for which we use them.
Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit www.aboutcookies.org or www.allaboutcookies.org.
To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites visit http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
Transferring Your Data
We may transfer your data to countries outside the European Economic Area (the "EEA").
Some of those countries have a European Commission adequacy decision, which means they are considered to offer an adequate level of data protection.
Other countries do not have the same level of legal protection as countries in the EEA, or with an adequacy decision. If we do transfer your data in this way, we will take steps to ensure that it is protected to the same levels that apply in the EEA. This may include, for example, ensuring that the organisation receiving the data is registered with the EU-US Privacy Shield (in the case of transfers to the USA), or that we use the EU’s model contract clauses.
Storing Your Data
We have a data retention policy, which clearly sets out how long we keep data for, and for what reasons.
We will keep your data only for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose/s for which it was collected in the first place, i.e. as set out in this notice.
