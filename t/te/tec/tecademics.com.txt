Tecademics reserves the right to transfer all personal information in its possession to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of Tecademics’ assets.

Personal information submitted or collected after a transfer, however, may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by Tecademics’ successor organization, if any.
If you have failed to pay any balance owed in consideration of products or services, Tecademics may, as permitted by law, report your personal information, including without limitation, your unpaid balance, to consumer credit reporting services, collection agencies and others.
Tecademics occasionally may assign prospective sales and new independent contractors leads to independent contractors. In these cases, Tecademics will provide the lead with the appropriate independent contractors name and contact information. In addition, Tecademics may have an Independent Contractor Locator feature on its Website. Pursuant to this feature, a prospective customer or new independent contractor can locate a nearby Tecademics independent contractor. In order to make the Independent Contractor Locator feature and the lead assignments effective, the Company will provide the prospective customer or new independent contractor with the independent contractor’s name and contact information, which may include his/her telephone number, address, and/or email address.

COMMUNICATIONS FROM US
When enrolling as an independent contractor, registering as registered customer, or making a purchase or other inquiry through the Website, you consent to receive periodic email and other communications from us and from Tecademics independent contractors. For example, Tecademics sends all new independent contractors and registered customers a welcoming email to verify password, username, and acceptance of the Independent Contractor’s Agreement or Customer Agreement. All independent contractors and registered customers will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Customers who have not registered with Tecademics and who grant permission will also receive occasional information on products, services, special deals, and the like.
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service-related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send independent contractors or customers an email. Generally, independent contractors may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their accounts. These communications are not promotional in nature.
Tecademics communicates with independent contractors and registered customers via email, regular mail and telephone on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their Tecademics business. Tecademics communicates with other customers with respect to products or services purchased by such customers from Tecademics. Such communications may be by email, regular mail or telephone.
