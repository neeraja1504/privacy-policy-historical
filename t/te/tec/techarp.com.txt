What Has Surfing Got To Do With Privacy?
Just in case you haven't heard, many sites can and do nefariously collect data about your surfing habits. They do that by sending you a cookie which then tracks your online movements. The data is then retrieved and used for marketing purposes but their use may not necessarily stop there.
Some of these cookie-sending sites do specifically state that they are sending out tracking cookies and their purpose for doing so. You should still take their words with a pinch of salt although they tend to use the data for rather innocuous uses.
It's the sites that secretly send out tracking cookies that are a threat to your privacy. As such, it's important to be aware of the privacy policy of the sites you visit.
Are All Cookies Dangerous?
Well, there's no danger per se that one can encounter from a cookie. They merely pose a threat to your privacy by tracking your surfing habits. However, cookies are required for many purposes.
Advertising agencies use them to count the number of hits and page views correctly while obtaining demographic information for the webmaster's use. Other services use them to facilitate logging in processes and store customization information for a visitor. So, you shouldn't avoid or disable all cookies. Just avoid receiving cookies that have been sent to your computer for no valid reason.
