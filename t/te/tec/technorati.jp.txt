By visiting Technorati’s primary website or related websites that Technorati controls or operates (collectively “Technorati Sites”), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Statement.
What this Privacy Statement Covers
This Privacy Statement covers Technorati’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that Technorati gathers when you access Technorati Sites. This Privacy Statement does not apply to the use of your Personal Information by third parties that Technorati does not own or control, or to individuals that Technorati does not control or manage.

Technorati is the sole owner of information collected on Technorati Sites. We do not share or sell your information with anyone without your authorization or consent in ways different from what is disclosed in this Privacy Statement.
Registration
Technorati provides some features exclusively to its members. Our registration process requires you to provide Technorati with a valid email address as well as a username and password of your choice. Optional information such as your first and last name, year of birth, zip code, and country of residence helps Technorati have a better understanding of its visitors and members. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of special features offered only to our members.
Weblog Quickclaim
As a convenience to its members, Technorati provides the option of claiming a weblog by logging into the administrative interface of their blogging (blog publishing) service. Technorati does not store this login information on our service; we only use this data to determine if you have the ability to alter data on the specified blog.

Technorati provides its members a feature, which gives people the ability to store and retrieve an Attention.xml file containing personal attention history. Technorati does not share this information with other parties.
Minor's Privacy
We do not collect or maintain information on Technorati Sites from those people we actually know are under 13 years old, and no part of any Technorati Site is structured to attract anyone under 13 years old.
Surveys or Contests
We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on Technorati Sites. If you participate we will request certain Personal Information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

We only use this information internally to determine eligibility, notify contest winners, and to measure the success of our efforts.
