Our Privacy Policy
We consider your privacy to be of paramount importance.
Your contact details are safe with us
We don't pester you
Very occasionally, we may send you some information about our products or a partner's product or about special offers. As at October 2011, this has happened way less than once a year.
Update notices
Some of our products (in particular, FormMail) regularly check our server for updates. When a newer version is found, it will attempt to email you regarding the new version.
Note that in the case of FormMail, it is your server sending you email - we have no involvement in the process.
These update checks are entirely automated, and we have no direct control over them. We also don't receive any information about who is performing an update check (other than our normal web server logs).
You can switch off these update checks.
We don't like spam and we actively fight spammers!Â  We will never give your contact details to anyone else.
We do not share our customer lists or user lists with anyone.
We oppose spam!
We don't purchase lists of email addresses, and we don't use automated bulk-mail software programs.
Our free FormMail product actively fights spam on the Internet.
Your privacy and our forums
Our forums are specifically setup to prevent other users from accessing your email address.
Our forums are now in readonly mode, and we have disabled all email functions in the forums.
If you don't want us to contact you...
We won't. Simply tell us you don't want us to email you and we won't. We'll immediately update our CRM to ensure we never send you an email again. (We'll send you one more email to confirm to you that we've complied with your request.)
