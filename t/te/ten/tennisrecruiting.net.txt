TennisRecruiting encourages parents and guardians to monitor and participate in their children's online activities.

If you are under 13 years of age, do not send any information about yourself to TennisRecruiting. USERS UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE ARE NOT PERMITTED TO REGISTER AT TENNISRECRUITING.NET.

Information for a child under 13 years of age can only be submitted by a parent or legal guardian. TennisRecruiting will ask you to indicate your age to verify compliance with these policies.
All information we collect is in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.).

You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information, such as your name and address or e-mail id, to correspond with you, to process an order, or to provide you with a subscription. We intend to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you. If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or relative, we will assume that you have their permission to do so.
USING AND SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION
The following paragraphs describe in more detail how TennisRecruiting may use your personal information and with whom we may share it. Depending on the area of TennisRecruiting.net you are visiting, one or more of the paragraphs may apply. For example, if you order a product from TennisRecruiting, your information will be handled as described in such paragraphs as Fulfilling Your Transaction Request and Marketing Use.
FULFILLING YOUR TRANSACTION REQUEST
If you request something from the TennisRecruiting.net Website, for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share information, with others, for instance, TennisRecruiting's business partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, postal or government authorities (for example, Customs authorities) involved in fulfillment. In connection with a transaction we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.

This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide a better service.
COOKIES
We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our websites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on the TennisRecruiting.net Websites, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." TennisRecruiting, or others on behalf of TennisRecruiting may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service.
Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies.
We collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some TennisRecruiting.net pages use cookies, sent by TennisRecruiting.net or its third party vendors, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the Website. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some websites may not work properly.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
