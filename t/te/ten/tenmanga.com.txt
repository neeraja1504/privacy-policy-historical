TenManga does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13.

If TenManga learns that a child under the age of 13 has become a member, we will close that child's account and delete any information collected about the child.
Not withstanding the foregoing, TenManga may choose to retain some personal information such as the child's e-mail address as a means to prevent the child from re-registering at our website. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) went into effect in April 2000, and as a result websites all over the world wide web had to change their standards to not collect any information from a child.
