Privacy Policy
Your privacy is of the utmost importance to me unless I’m desperately trying to stalk you. Then? All bets are off. But, seeing how I don’t harvest any information here, I think you’re safe.
Just so you are aware, now that I’m monetizing, I use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit this Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
With that, back to the fun!
