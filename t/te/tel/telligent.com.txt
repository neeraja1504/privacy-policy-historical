What personal information does Telligent collect?
On Telligent web sites you can order products or services, register products, request information, subscribe to marketing or support materials, register to a secure extranet site to obtain access to product information, support, services and training, or apply for jobs at Telligent. Telligent may collect information about individuals such as their name, address, telephone number or email address, user IDs and passwords, billing and transaction information, credit card, or other financial information and contact preferences. Personal information collected online may be supplemented with information you provide to Telligent through other Telligent services, as well as other sources such as trade shows or seminars, and other data appending methods such as spot tags, tracking and cookies as referenced below.
How does Telligent use personal information?
Telligent will use personal information to provide customers, business partners and website visitors with information and services and to help us better understand your needs and interests. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction or order, to communicate with you, to deliver products/services to you, to bill you for products/services you purchased, and to provide ongoing service and support. We may also pass on your information to a third party, such as a partner, if you have asked us to do so. Occasionally we may use your information to contact you to complete surveys that we use for marketing and quality assurance purposes.
With whom does Telligent share personal information?
Telligent contracts with third party service providers and suppliers (including distributors and resellers) to deliver certain products, services and customer solutions. Telligent may share personal information with its service providers and suppliers to the extent needed to deliver the service or respond to requests for information on products or services or otherwise support the customers’ business needs. Third party service providers and suppliers receiving personal information are expected to apply the same level of privacy protection as contained in this Privacy Statement. They are required to keep confidential the personal information received from Telligent and may not use it for any purpose other than as originally intended.
Some Telligent services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both Telligent and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.
Except as described in this Privacy Statement, Telligent is not in the business of selling or renting your information to others and will not share personally identifiable information with other third parties without your permission, unless required by, or in connection with, law enforcement action, subpoena or other litigation, or applicable law or in connection with a prospective or actual sale, merger, transfer or other reorganization of all or parts of our business, or within the group of affiliated Telligent companies, if and to the extent legally permissible.
We reserve the right to fully use and disclose any information that is not in personally identifiable form.
