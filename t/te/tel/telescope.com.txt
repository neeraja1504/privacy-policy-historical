Privacy | Orion Telescopes & Binoculars
Privacy Policy
Welcome to the Orion Telescopes & Binoculars website, Telescope.com (the "Site"). Orion Telescopes & Binoculars has created this Privacy Policy in order to set forth the principles governing our information-gathering and dissemination practices in connection with the Site, including but not limited to such activities as the offering for sale of services and merchandise, as well as forums, chat rooms, personal profile pages, product reviews, article commentary, blogs, RSS feeds, newsletters and eCommerce, among other offerings (the "Web Site Activities"). Orion Telescopes & Binoculars has a strong commitment to the privacy of our Site's users. Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the Site and not to information collected offline or to information you may provide to any third-party sites to which our Site may link, except as expressly provided herein.
Information We Collect
There are two kinds of information that Web sites can obtain about you: "Anonymous Information" and "Personally Identifiable Information."
"Anonymous Information" consists of non-personally-identifiable data, such as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address or domain, or information about your usage of our Site that is used for administrative purposes only. For example, an IP address is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We may collect our users' IP addresses for such purposes as to help diagnose problems with our servers and to report aggregate information to our advertisers, corporate affiliates and consultants, and to third parties that perform particular services on our behalf. We may also collect IP addresses as a security precaution when customers initiate orders through our Site, because although IP addresses themselves are non-personally identifiable, they are linked to information about you that is personally identifiable.
We may also use the information linked to IP addresses to ban users who violate our Terms and Conditions of use.
"Personally Identifiable Information" is any information that personally identifies you, such as your name, street address, email address, telephone number or credit card number. We collect such information when, for example, you enter a contest, subscribe to our email newsletter, participate in other interactive online activities such as forums, or order merchandise through our Site.
NOTE: DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CREDIT CARD INFORMATION IN ANY EMAIL OR LIVE CHAT COMMUNICATION. IF YOU DO, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT YOUR INFORMATION WILL REMAIN SECURE, AND WE THEREFORE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSSES THAT YOU MAY SUFFER AS A RESULT.
Any and all of your Personally Identifiable Information (with the exception of your credit card information, which is always kept confidential) may be used to help us maintain your account, and also to enable us and our business partners to send you announcements of new Site features, special offers and promotional material. However, if you decide that you do not wish to receive future email communications from Orion Telescopes & Binoculars, you may follow the "Unsubscribe" instructions on the communication you have received.
If you purchase a product through our Site, your email address will be used to send your order and shipping confirmations, as well as other relevant correspondence regarding your order. We may also collect your email address if you order a product catalog. We may subsequently send you emails related to our products or services. If you do not want to receive product-related emails from us, you may follow the "Unsubscribe" instructions on the communication you have received or contact us as follows:
Orion Telescopes & Binoculars: sales@telescope.com or 800-447-1001
If you supply us with your postal address, you may receive catalogs or mailings from us with information on products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please contact us as follows:
Orion Telescopes & Binoculars: sales@telescope.com or 800-447-1001
Also, as a customer of our Site, you may receive postal mailings from other reputable companies. You can have your name put on our "do-not-share" list by contacting us as follows:
Orion Telescopes & Binoculars: sales@telescope.com or 800-447-1001
Whenever you contact us in this fashion, please provide us with your exact name and address. We will make sure that you are removed from the postal address list we occasionally share with other organizations.
If you are a customer of our Site, you may change your email information or your postal address information by sending an email to us as follows:
Orion Telescopes & Binoculars: sales@telescope.com or 800-447-1001
We may attempt to verify personal information to detect and prevent fraudulent activity including billing address, phone number and ship-to address information submitted with an order by contacting the credit card issuer, and using the services of LexisNexis and/or Cybersource.
FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION, NEVER SEND CREDIT CARD INFORMATION VIA EMAIL OR LIVE CHAT. WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF EMAIL TRANSMISSIONS AND THUS CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSSES THAT YOU MAY SUFFER AS A RESULT.
In all cases, we will only use your information as permitted by law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Privacy Policy, however, we may disclose Personally Identifiable Information to others if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights and property; (c) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site; or (d) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public. Please note that we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.

Our Site has reasonable security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Security of information communicated by or to us over the Internet is of utmost concern to us; however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
