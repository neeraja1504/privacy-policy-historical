OUR PRIVACY PROMISE TO YOU
At certain points while using TeleportMyJob.com, information is collected that helps with the services we provide our users. We value your privacy and provide you with the following statement to inform and assure you on how we look after your information.

During registration you are required to give us contact information and some demographics (such as gender, age). Please enter the information as honestly and accurately as possible so we can better tailor the site to our users’ needs.
Your Friend’s E-mail Address
At various points throughout TeleportMyJob.com, we offer you the opportunity to send a friend an email telling them about a particular service. We will only use your friend's email address once in order to send this message. After this, they will not be sent any more emails from us unless they voluntarily register to any of our services.
We are aware some people may abuse our “Email to Friend” system to send emails to a person who is NOT a friend and does not want to get an email from us. If someone using our system sends you something you don't want, we apologise.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. This is a common web technology used by most modern websites and we use cookies in line with commonly accepted practice.
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use a session cookie to make it easier for you to navigate our site and it expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.
This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by TeleportMyJob.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers or third parties.
Web Beacons, Clear GIFS, Web Bugs
TeleportMyJob.com and the advertisers on our site employ a common web tool called clear GIFS or web beacons on the website and in emails. These are used in combination with cookies to allow us to better understand our users’ behaviour. They provide us with basic information such as if an email has been opened, what has been viewed on the website, which ads were clicked on, etc. By using the data provided by these beacons, we are able to hone our site and improve our services. Your personal details are in no way linked to the information gathered from web beacons.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
We DO NOT share your personal information with any third parties without your permission. We do share general data that you have provided us such as age, gender, location etc to provide broad statistics to third party advertisers and partners. This information does not identify individual users and is not linked to your personally identifiable information.
When delivering your information to potential recruiters and employers, your profile and CV/Resume is delivered to through the network. You are responsible to ensure that any information on your CV/Resume that you would like to remain confidential, is removed from the document prior to you uploading it on to the TeleportMyJob.com servers. You are also able to make some profile information private, by accessing the settings area in your control panel.
We reserve the right to supply personal information in order to comply with the law and to enforce user agreement terms or protect the rights, safety or property of TeleportMyJob.com and its users or others.
