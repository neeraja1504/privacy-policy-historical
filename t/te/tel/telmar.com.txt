If you have any requests concerning your PII or any questions with regard to our practices, please contact our Privacy Officer at PrivacyOfficer@telmar.com.

All PII you provide may be transferred or accessed by any Telmar entity around the world as described in this Privacy Notice. If you are a resident of a European Economic Area (“EEA”) country, Telmar Communications Ltd. is the controller and responsible for any PII they collect regarding EEA residents; As Telmar has a number of legal entities in different jurisdictions for all other citizens of other countries, Telmar Group, Inc., is the controller and responsible for any PII they collect.

Marketing:
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain PII uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.
Promotional offers from us:
We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you and your employer (we call this marketing).
You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or you or your employer has purchased products or services from us and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
Opting out:
You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time.
Change of purpose:
We will only use your PII for the purposes for which we collected it unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
If we need to use your PII for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to use it.
Please note that we may process your PII without your knowledge or consent in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
Retention of Information:
We will only retain your PII for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for PII, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the PII, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your PII, the purposes for which we process your PII and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
Details of retention periods for different aspects of your PII are available in our retention policy which you can request from us by contacting our PrivacyOfficer@telmar.com.
International Transfers:
If you are resident in the EEA, then you need to be aware that we will need to transfer your PII outside of the EEA. Whenever we transfer your PII out of the EEA, we will ensure that it is protected with a similar degree of protection that is afforded to it in the EEA by implementing at least one of the following safeguards:
We will only transfer your PII to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for PII by the European Commission (EU). For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of PII in non-EU countries;
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give PII the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of PII to third countries at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en.
Your Rights :
Under certain circumstances, you have the following rights under the data protection laws in relation to your PII, which are explained below:
The right to access;
The right to rectification;
The right to complain to a supervisory authority;
The right to be forgotten;
The right to restrict
Object to processing;
The right to transfer; and
The right to withdraw consent.
Access/Confirmation:
You can request access to your PII (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the PIII we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
H ow to Correct Your Information:
You can correct factual errors in your PII by sending us a request that credibly and specifically documents error to our Privacy Officer noted below. Taking into account the purpose of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete or inaccurate PII corrected. We may need to verify the accuracy of the new PII you provide to us.
Complain to a Supervisory Authority :
If you are not satisfied with how we manage your PII, you have the right to make a complaint to a data protection regulator. A list of National Data Protection Authorities can be found here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.
In the UK, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.
Right to be Forgotten:
You can ask us to delete or remove any PII we hold concerning you.  This enables you to ask us to delete or remove PII where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your PII where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your PII to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Request restriction of processing:
In some circumstances, you have the right to ask us to suspend the processing of your PII. Those circumstances are: (a) you contest the accuracy of the PII; (b) processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; (c) we no longer need the PII for the purposes of our processing, but you require the PII for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our processing of your PII, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your PII.
Objection to processing:
You also have the right to object to our use of PII when we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third-party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing because you believe it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the
right to object where we are processing your PII for direct marking purposes and for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation. We will respect your request unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your PII which override your rights and freedoms.
Data Transfer/Portability:
You have the right to request the transfer of your PII to you or to a third-party. We will provide to you, or a third-party you have chosen, your PII in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use.
Withdraw Consent:
You may withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your PII. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
Security and storage of information:
We will keep your PII secure by taking appropriate technical and organizational measures against its unauthorized or unlawful processing and against its accidental loss, access, destruction, or damage. We will do our best to protect your PII but we cannot guarantee the security of your data which is transmitted to our Websites, applications or services or to other websites, applications, and services via an internet or similar connection.
Data Breaches:
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
