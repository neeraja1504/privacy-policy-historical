India and the Spam Menace:
Spam legislation is non-existent in India. The much-touted Information Technology Act of 2000 does not discuss the issue of spamming at all. It only refers to punishment meted out to a person, who after having secured access to any electronic material without the consent of the person concerned, discloses such electronic material to any other person. It does not have any bearing on violation of individual’s privacy in Cyberspace. The illegality of spamming is not considered.
The IT Act 2000 in India prohibits malicious communication through electronic means.
