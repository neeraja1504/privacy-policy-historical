The gathered information concerns data that could allow to identify web users/visitors by associating and processing them with other data kept by third parties (such as, for example, the IP address, domain and registration numbers of the computers used by people connecting to the website).
These data are used and processed only for statistic purposes (therefore, they are anonymous) and to check if the website is working correctly. They are deleted as soon as they have been processed in such a way.
Data concerning web contacts are not stored for a longer period than seven days except for any need of checking computer crimes damaging the website.

If users/visitors connecting to this website send their personal data in order to use some services or to make requests through e-mail, Telecom Italia gathers their addresses and/or any other personal data, which will be processed exclusively to fulfil the demand or to provide the requested service.
Personal data provided by web users/visitors will be communicated to third parties only in case it is necessary to comply with their requests.
3) Cookies
Cookies for the transmission of personal data are not used and neither are used any so-called persistent cookies, that is systems for the tracking of users.
The use of the so-called session cookies (that, in any case, are not stored persistently on the user’s computer and are deleted automatically as soon as the browser is shut down) is strictly limited to the purpose of transmitting data (made up of random numbers created by the server) identifying the specific session and necessary to allow a safe and efficient website surfing.
The so-called session cookies used in this website avoid any other computer methods that could potentially compromise the privacy about users’web-surfing and they do not make it possible to obtain personal data identifying the specific user.
Methods of data processing
Data are processed both through computer-based tools (such as electronic procedures) and manually (such as on paper-based procedures) only for the limited time period necessary for the purposes according to which they have been gathered and, anyway, in compliance with the related law.
Optional communication of personal data
Apart from what has been specified previously about navigation data, web users/visitors can decide they want to provide their personal data. Not communicating them only implies that users’requests will not be fulfilled.
