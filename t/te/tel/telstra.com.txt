How do we use your information?

Administration - Your information helps us to properly manage the products and services we provide to you and to maintain and update our records.  For example, we need to be able to verify your identity to detect, prevent and address fraud, security or technical issues. We also use your information for charging and billing.
Communication - We need to be able to communicate with you in order to provide you with our products and services. We might do this on different types of mediums such as email, SMS, social media, search engines and web pages you may visit. This helps us enhance your experience with our products and services.
Improvement -  We’re constantly working to not only maintain and improve our products and services but to develop new ones.  We use information we hold to help us do this in a number of ways. For example to monitor network use, quality and performance, and to operate, maintain, develop, test and upgrade our systems and infrastructure.

We may also combine information from one service with information from one of our partners’ services.
Development and Analysis -  It’s important we understand your information and communication needs. One of the ways we do this is through using analysis business intelligence techniques.  This gives us high level insights into things like usage patterns, network performance, demographic trends and other types of behavioural data.  In many cases this information is aggregated and de-identified when analysed. We may share these anonymised insights with select partners. In some cases we may create insights with your information on an identified basis but in those cases we would need to do so with your consent or otherwise comply with privacy laws.
Direct Marketing - We want to make sure that you know about all our products, services and special offers that are relevant and are of interest to you.  So sometimes we may use the information we hold to market and promote them directly to you. This also may include products, services and offers provided by one of our trusted partners.  In some cases this marketing activity can continue after you’ve stopped using our products or services, and until you opt-out. You can stop us using your information for direct marketing by calling us on 1800 039 059 or updating your preference by logging into your 'My Account' online.
Compliance - There are a number of circumstances where we are required or authorised by law to collect, use or disclose information.  These include:

To produce and distribute an alphabetical public number directory (known as the White Pages) in compliance with our Carrier Licence Conditions.
