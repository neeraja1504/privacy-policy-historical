V. How We Use Your Information.
The primary use for your information is to provide you with services you have requested and/or paid for. We also use your information to deliver customized services to you; for member support purposes; and for efforts to monitor and ensure against fraud. Non-personal and aggregate information, such as that collected passively, is used in order to customize our marketing efforts or to customize the use of our site for an aggregate group of customers. We will not use the personal information of users whose membership have expired or have been cancelled in order to market our services to such individuals in the future. Rather, all such personal information will be retained for the life of the Site in the Site's protected database.
Please note, the personal information collected will not be shared with third-parties, and is only intended for use by the COMPANY. We generally will use your information for the purposes for which you specifically provide it including, for example, to ensure payment for subscription services.
VI. Special Cases.
It is our policy not to use or share the personal information about Non-Members or Members in ways unrelated to those described in this Policy without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, we may disclose personal information about Non-Members or Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including:
1. To satisfy any laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental, or legal requests for such information;
2. To disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or other user policies;
3. To operate our Services properly;
4. To protect ourselves, our Members, and the general public. We specifically reserve the right to disclose any and all information to law enforcement in the event that a crime – including, but not limited to, fraud-related offense – is committed, is suspected, or if we are compelled to do so by lawful criminal, civil, or administrative process, discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders, writs, or reasonable request of authorities or persons with the reasonable power to obtain such process.

Examples of such cooperation include lawful criminal, civil, or administrative process, discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders, or writs.
VII. Transmittals From Us.
We presently do not intend to send e-mails to our Members, other than in response to specific Member inquiries; and/or in order to provide Members with system notices and other information specifically relating to your account. In the future, this policy may be subject to change, and we could opt to initiate the sending of other correspondence including, but not limited to, Member announcements. The implementation of such changes will be reflected in the Site's privacy policy. We strongly advise our Members to periodically review the terms of this policy in order to stay apprised of any such changes.
If you provide your information to us, use the Site, or subscribe to any of our services, you will have created a commercial relationship with us. Even though the Site does not intend to provide Members with e-mail advertising materials, your use of the Site and its services constitutes your understanding and consent that even unsolicited commercial email sent from us or our affiliates is not SPAM as that term is defined under the law.
VIII. Public Forums and Member Directories.
A. Public Forums – At the time of the institution of this Policy, we do not offer any public forums, nor do we provide services that allow Members to post messages to the public, nor to the membership at large.

Public forums are accessed via e-mail address, user name, and password.
B. Member Directories – Any information provided in a user profile, member directory, or other related service should be considered to be private information. Such information will not be made public or visible in any way.
IX. Our Commitment To Data Security.
We take measures, including data encryption, to protect the transmission of all sensitive end-user information. We make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party ‘hackers' from illegally obtaining this information. We take all reasonable measures to prevent such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of cyber-criminals we are unable to guarantee that our security is 100% breach-proof. You assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that they occur despite our reasonable security measures.
Further, we do not provide user information to third parties; nor will we sell, rent or provide any of your information to other entities such as advertisers, or other companies selling services similar to this COMPANY's services
