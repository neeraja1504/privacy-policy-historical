Information TeenGrowth Collects
Personal Information
TeenGrowth does not require that you register personal information such as full names, postal addresses or telephone numbers to access the educational resources on the site. However, TeenGrowth does collect limited information when you access certain areas of the site.

The information collected is to help us better understand your needs and is never given or sold to third parties.
Your e-mail address may be used in the "Ask Us" area to contact you directly regarding the question you submitted to our Medical Advisory Board. However, this is only done if you give us permission when you submit the question or if the Advisory Board feels it's in your best interest to contact you, such as in cases of questions related to severe depression or suicide.

This allows us to know which pages you visited, how long you spent on each page, which browser you used to visit the site, the domain name of your Internet provider and how much time you spent on TeenGrowth. The cookies do not identify your personal information such as your name or e-mail address.
