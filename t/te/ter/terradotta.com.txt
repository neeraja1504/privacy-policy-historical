When you place orders or access your personal account information, you're utilizing a secure connection via SSL, which encrypts your personal information before it's sent over the Internet. SSL is one of the safest encryption technologies available.
Terra Dotta provides information and training to all employees who have access to personally identifiable data maintained by Terra Dotta, and Terra Dotta employees are responsible for the internal security of such information.

8. WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION YOU SHARE.
When you provide us with your contact information, including your name and email address, we may use this information to send you updates about our site, questionnaires to measure your satisfaction with our service, and announcements about new services that we offer. When you order from us, we ask for your credit card number and billing address. We use this information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that time.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, and answering customer questions about products or services. We only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
Terra Dotta will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the requirements of the law or comply with legal process served on Terra Dotta or the site, or in response to governmental orders, subpoenas, search warrants, or other governmental request; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Terra Dotta and its family of Web sites, and, (c) protect the personal safety, rights and property of Terra Dotta, users of Terra Dotta Web sites, or others.
