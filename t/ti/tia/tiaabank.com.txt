How Your Information Is Used
We use your personal information primarily to provide you with the products and services you request, and we share and
use your personal information relating to transactions, balances, payment history and similar experiences among the TIAA
companies to conduct their business. As permitted by law, we may also share your personal information with select partners
with whom we have joint marketing agreements in order to provide you with a variety of products and services. We require
these companies to meet privacy standards described below. Unless you have told us otherwise pursuant to “Your Right To
Opt-Out” below, we may also use your personal information to market or determine your possible interest in products and
services that the other TIAA companies offer. If you are a participant in an employer-sponsored retirement or savings plan
investing in a TIAA or third-party annuity contract or a TIAA or third-party mutual fund, we may share the information we
collect with your employer and its agents, if any, for plan administration purposes.
Disclosure of Your Information
We share your personal information with other TIAA companies as permitted by law. We will not disclose your personal
information to anyone outside of the TIAA companies unless: 1) we have received proper consent from you;

to protect the confidentiality of your personal information, including personal information that we have disclosed to a third
party pursuant to this Privacy Notice, we take appropriate measures, including requiring each third party to execute an
appropriate confidentiality agreement governing the use of such information and only allowing access to the information for a
limited purpose. For example, we may provide the information to assist us with various aspects of conducting our business,
to comply with laws or industry regulations, and/or to effectuate any contract on your behalf, including the following:
Unaffiliated service providers (e.g., fulfillment companies and securities clearinghouses, data processing services, printers and
mailing facilities) engaged by us;
Unaffiliated service providers (e.g., third-party administrators) engaged by your employer;
Unaffiliated fund and/or insurance companies and their agents whose investment options are made available to you through your
employer-sponsored retirement or savings plan, provided monies are allocated to them on your behalf;
Government agencies, other regulatory bodies and law enforcement officials (e.g., for tax purposes or for reporting suspicious
transactions);
Other organizations, with your consent or as directed by you (e.g., if you use TIAA as a financial reference in applying for credit with
another institution); and
Other organizations, as permitted or required by law (e.g., for fraud prevention).
We require that third parties with which we share your personal information protect such information by utilizing the privacy
and security safeguards required by law.
Security of Your Information
TIAA protects the personal information you provide against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, destruction, loss, or
misuse. Your personal information is protected by physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in accordance with federal
and state standards. These safeguards include appropriate procedures for access and use of electronic data, provisions for
the secure transmission of sensitive personal information on our website, and telephone system authentication procedures.
Additionally, we limit access to your personal information to those TIAA employees and agents who need your personal
information in order to offer and provide products or services to you.
Your Right to Opt Out
Providing us with access to your information permits us to offer you distinct advantages and better service. It enables us to
provide you with more comprehensive financial guidance. In fact, we have established different TIAA companies to offer you
various types of financial products and services. Sharing and using your information helps us tailor product offerings to you
and eliminate those that may not interest you. This helps us keep expenses low.
Federal law gives you the right to limit some but not all sharing of your personal information. You may not limit sharing of
information of your transactions and experiences with TIAA companies, but you may limit sharing of information about your
creditworthiness.
Unless you tell us otherwise, (i) the TIAA company(ies) with which you have a business relationship may share information
about your creditworthiness with other TIAA companies or (ii) other TIAA companies may use your personal information for
marketing purposes. If you are a Vermont resident, state law gives you an additional right: we will not share information
about your creditworthiness with other TIAA companies except with your consent.
If you do not want the TIAA company(ies) with which you have a business relationship to share information about your
creditworthiness with other TIAA companies or other TIAA companies to use your personal financial information for
marketing purposes, you may simply let us know by opting out. If you opt-out, the TIAA company(ies) with
which you have a business relationship may still notify you of their new products or services. Please note that we cannot
withdraw any previous disclosures made with your authorization.
To opt out of either information sharing or marketing, or both, please call the National Contact Center weekdays from 8:00 a.m.
to 10 p.m., and on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m, (ET) at 877-518-9161.
You may receive more than one privacy notice from the TIAA companies depending on the products you own.
If you own a life insurance contract, brokerage account or a TIAA-CREF Funds account with a co-owner, you and the co-
owner may:
opt out separately; or
either of you may opt out for both of you.
If you opt out separately, we will limit disclosure of information only for the owner who has opted out. If you indicate that you
are opting out for the co-owner as well, we will limit disclosure for both of you.
Your opt-out becomes effective as soon as practicable. It remains in effect until you revoke it in writing. No further action is
needed. Even if you have opted out, you will receive our privacy notice each year as required by law.
Children's Privacy Online
This website is not directed toward children. We do not knowingly collect or post information from children under the age
