1. About this policy
Tigerair Australia is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. This Privacy Policy tells you how Tiger Airways Australia Pty Ltd ("we"/ "our"/ "us") will handle your personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), including the Australian Privacy Principles.
We also provide specific privacy collection notices relating to our particular services and practices, where required under Australian Privacy Principle 5 (“Privacy Statements”). You can access our Privacy Statements here.
We will update our Privacy Policy if the way we handle personal information changes or as required by law. Updates to our Privacy Policy will be published on our website.
2. Collecting your personal information
2.1 Types of information we collect
The personal information we collect will depend on your relationship with us and the service you have requested. It may include:
your identity and contact details including: name, address, email address, phone number, date of birth, gender, passport or other identification details and photograph;
payment information in connection with a booking or additional product or service purchased through our website, Customer Care Centre, or during your flight.
itinerary and other travel related information (such as special assistance requirements);
IP address or MAC address when using our website or mobile applications;
if you use social media to interact with us, any information that you allow the social media site to share with us; and
information relating to your dealings with us, including developing insights about you so that we can better understand your preferences and interests.
2.2 Collecting sensitive information
We may collect health or other sensitive information about you:
if relevant to your travel arrangements, for example, where you make a "Special Assistance" request, provide your dietary requirements or otherwise provide us with health information;
have a medical condition and are required to complete a medical clearance form; or
are involved in a safety investigation, complaint or claim.
Depending on the circumstances in which we are collecting health information from you, we collect health information so that we can:
establish your requirements and make any Special Assistance or other travel arrangements for you;
process your medical clearance form; or
investigate safety incidents or accidents, complaints or claims.
By providing your health information to us, you consent to us collecting your health information and using and disclosing it for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will not use your health information for marketing purposes.
2.3 Anonymity
Where possible, we will allow you to interact with us anonymously or using a pseudonym. For example, if you contact Customer Care with a general enquiry, you may choose not to provide your name unless we need it to adequately handle your enquiry.
However, for most of our functions and activities we usually need your name and contact information.
2.4 How we collect personal information
We collect your personal information in a number of ways. We may collect your personal information directly from you or in the course of our dealings with you, for example when you:
provide personal information to us, for example, when you make or update a booking, subscribe to our email or other communications, enter a competition, provide feedback to us or otherwise interact with us;
visit our website, social media channels or mobile applications;
apply for a position with us;
complete a form for us, such as medical clearance, claim and unaccompanied minor forms; or
contact us by phone or through our website. We generally record our calls and so we will collect any personal information you provide during the call.
We may also collect personal information about you from someone other than you. This may include our related entities and:
a person who makes, changes or enquires about a flight or other booking on your behalf or who otherwise interacts with us on your behalf (such as a family member, travel or booking agents, sales agents or your employer or other representative as part of a corporate or group booking);
recruitment agencies and previous employers, if you have applied for a position with us and with your consent;

government agencies and regulatory authorities, including immigration and border security and police, and airport security.
We may combine and/or compare personal information we hold about you with other information collected from, or held by, others. We do this to better understand your interests and preferences, which helps us to enhance your experience. More information about why we do this is provided under 'Why we collect personal information'.

We also use web tracking/analytic tools that generate detailed statistics about traffic to our website, traffic sources and how you interact with advertisements on our websites and third party websites. These tools can also measure and record conversions and sales.
The cookies and web-tracking tools allow our websites and mobile applications to interact more efficiently with the device you are using and to help us improve the content and functioning of our website and mobile applications.

9. How we hold your personal information and keep it safe
9.1 Our systems
We mostly hold personal information electronically in our IT systems and databases. We also hold personal information in telephone recordings and in hard copy paper files. We use third party service providers to store some personal information.
We take steps to protect the information that we hold about you from misuse, interference and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
We do this by having physical and electronic security systems and by limiting who can access your personal information. We also have online and network security systems in place for our websites, so that the information you provide us online is protected and secure. However, because of the nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. Please contact us if you become aware of any breach of security.
9.2 Keeping your booking safe
Your Passenger Reference Number (located at the top of your flight confirmation) is like your password for your booking.
You can help us protect your privacy by keeping your Passenger Reference Number safe. Don't share your Passenger Reference Number with any other person, unless you are happy for them to receive information from us about your booking and travel arrangements and to make changes to your booking.
We will only update a flight booking or otherwise provide information in relation to a booking (including passenger names, destinations, changes or interruptions to travel or no-shows) or provide copies of flight confirmations or tax invoices, if our verification criteria are met.
If you believe your Passenger Reference Number has been obtained by someone who you do not want to have access to your booking, please notify us immediately.
10. Your right to access and correct your personal information
You have a right to request access to or correction of the personal information we hold about you.
If you wish to access, correct or update any personal information we hold about you, please contact us on the details below. We will need to verify your identity before we can process your request.
We will respond to your request within a reasonable time of you making the request and give you access in the manner you requested, unless it is unreasonable or impracticable for us to do so.
Sometimes we will be able to respond to your query over the phone, but sometimes we may need your request in writing and we might need some time to gather the requested information and get back to you. These more complex requests usually take us between 14 and 30 days. We might need to send a copy of the information to you by post or we might ask you to come and see us to have a look at the information.
Making a request is free. But depending on what information you request access to, we may need to charge you for giving you access to the information. The charges will not be excessive and we'll let you know if a charge will apply before we proceed with giving you access. There is no charge for correcting your personal information.
There may be reasons why we cannot give you access to the information that you have requested, or we refuse to correct your personal information. If this is the case, we will let you know these reasons in writing. If we refuse you access or to correct your personal information, you can make a complaint about this, by following the complaint procedures in this Privacy Policy.
If we refuse to correct your personal information that we hold, you can ask us to associate with that information a statement that the information is inaccurate, out-of-date, irrelevant or misleading.
11. How to make a complaint
If you have a complaint about how we have handled your personal information, you can make a complaint by contacting us using the details below.
Once we have received your complaint, we will investigate and respond to you as soon as we can. We try to do this within 10 working days of receiving your complaint. If this is not possible, we will contact you and let you know when we will respond to your complaint.
We take any privacy complaint seriously and will deal with your complaint fairly and promptly. However if you are not satisfied with our response or how we handled your complaint, you may complain to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (in writing) at:
