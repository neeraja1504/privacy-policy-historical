We may also collect other event-related information from you.

If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, phone, or social networking service (e.g., Twitter or Facebook), we may collect your name and contact information, as well as any other content included in your communication to us, in order to send you a reply, and for other reasons as stated in this policy.
If you post content on publicly accessible portions of our Services, the information contained in your posting will be stored in our servers and other users will be able to see the content. If you signed in to your Account via a social networking site (“ SNS ”), your profile photo may be displayed along with your posted content.
If you respond to one of our surveys, we will collect any Personal Data you provide in your survey responses.
We (or service providers acting on our behalf) may also collect Personal Data to administer your participation in contests, sweepstakes or other promotions and at other points in our Services that state that Personal Data is being collected.
*(b) Information You Provide to Social Networking Sites.* If you elect to sign in to your Account via a SNS, you are allowing us to access information stored by the SNS, including, without limitation, your public user ID, public profile information, your email address, your “likes”, and your “shares”, and you are agreeing to the SNS’s terms of use as well as our Purchase Terms and Conditions (http://start.ticketfly.com/purchase-terms-and-conditions) and Terms of Service (http://start.ticketfly.com/terms-of-service) in connection with your use of the Services. The particular data that we collect from your SNS account may depend on the privacy settings you have selected with your SNS, so please consult the SNS’s privacy policy for more information.
(c) Information Collected from Client Users of Our Services. If you are an employee of a Ticketfly Client who has been granted access to the administrative tools and features of our Services, we may collect Personal Data from you in connection with the establishment of your access credentials and your use of our Services, including without limitation, your name, position, work email address, business address and work phone number and any records you create while using our Services. We will use and share this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, subject to any separate agreements we have negotiated with your employer.
(d) Information Collected Automatically.
Information Collected by Our Servers. To make our Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) may collect information from your computer or device, including but not limited to:
The date and time of your visit and the web pages, content and advertisements you view and links you click on while navigating within our Services;
Information about your interactions with any content appearing on our Services, such as the type of content accessed via our Services;
Information about your interactions with our email messages, such as the links you click on and whether you open or forward a message, the date and time of these interactions and the device you use to read emails;
The site you visited before and after visiting our Site;
Your Internet Protocol (IP) address (a numerical address assigned to your computer or device by your Internet service provider so that other computers or devices connected to the Internet can communicate with your computer or device online) that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area;
Search terms you enter using our Services or on a referral site;
Unique identifiers such as mobile device advertising identifiers and non-global mobile device identification numbers;
With your permission, your exact device location;
Information about your device such as your device type and model, screen size, browser type, language and other settings, memory capacity, advertising identifiers, operating system, Wi-Fi information, radio type (e.g. LTE, 3G, etc.), carrier code, and time zone; and
Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies (see additional descriptions of these terms below).
Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “ Cookies ” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Services. To turn off cookies, see “Your Choices Regarding Information” below.
Local Storage. Ticketfly and its advertising and technology partners may, in some instances, use HTML5 and/or Flash Local Storage (collectively, “ Local Storage “) to enhance your experiences on the Service.
Pixel Tags. We and our service providers also use “ Pixel Tags ” (sometimes referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to help us ensure that we are sending messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to, among other things, reduce the frequency of or eliminate messages sent to a user.
Do Not Track. We do not currently respond to “do not track” signals from web browsers.
Analytics Services. We use technology provided by third-party analytics services (“ Analytics Services ”) to help analyze how users use our Services. The information generated by Cookies or other technologies that monitor your use of our Services (“ Analytics Information ”) is collected by such Analytics Services (e.g., Google Analytics) so that they can compile reports on user activity. The Analytics Services may also transfer the Analytics Information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on their behalf. Each Analytics Service’s ability to use and share Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Service’s terms of use and privacy policy. By using our Services, you consent to the processing of data about you by Analytics Services in the manner and for the purposes set out above. To learn more about how Google Analytics uses data, visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
(e) Information Collected from Third Parties. We may combine information we collect through our Services with other information we obtain about you, your computer or device from other companies and sources, including Affiliates, Clients, and public databases, and use that information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This additional data may include, without limitation, additional contact information (name, postal address, email address and telephone number), information about your musical and other interests and purchase behavior, publicly-visible data, such as your posts and submissions to blogs and other interactive forums and additional demographic information. In addition, we may receive aggregated information from our data suppliers such as age and gender information to understand the demographics and interests of our users.
6. Use of Your Personal Data
(a) General Use. In general, Personal Data is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to help provide and improve our and our Clients’ products, services, content, and advertising for you and other users. We, our authorized service providers, and our Clients that offer the tickets you purchase or that host, organize or promote the events you browse on our Services, may use your Personal Data for a variety of purposes, including:
To facilitate the creation of and secure your Account on our network;
To identify you as a user in our system;
To provide improved administration of our Services;
To provide you with content that may be of interest to you;
To provide the tickets and Services you request;
To contact you in the event of changes to an event, such as a change in a seat assignment or cancellation of an event that you have purchased tickets to attend;
To measure and analyze audience traffic and improve the quality of your experience when you interact with our Services;
To send you a welcome e-mail to verify ownership of the e-mail address provided when your Account was created;
To send you administrative e-mail notifications, such as security, or support and maintenance advisories;
To respond to your inquiries or other requests;
To send newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials and for other marketing purposes;
To help recognize you as a previous visitor and save and remember your preferences and settings and deliver to you appropriate interest-based content;
To control the display of advertising and help deliver advertising tailored to your interests, from us, our Clients or others;
To understand how you use our Services. For example, we may use Personal Data to determine whether our users read email messages and click on links within those messages;
To detect and prevent fraud and other potentially prohibited or illegal activities, comply with applicable law and enforce our Terms of Service; and
For any other purposes disclosed to you at the time of collection or pursuant to your consent.
(b) Creation and/or Use of Anonymous Data. We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We reserve the right to use Anonymous Data for any purpose and disclose Anonymous Data to any third parties in our sole discretion.
7. Disclosure of Your Personal Data. We disclose your Personal Data as described below and as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. With your consent, we may also disclose Personal Data to third parties in other circumstances that we describe to you while you are using our Services.
(a) Ticketfly Clients. We may share the Personal Data we collect from or about you with the Clients that offer the tickets you purchase or that host, organize, operate or promote the events you browse while using our Services. For example, our Clients may receive a list of their customers who purchased tickets through our Services together with contact information, information about the tickets each customer purchased, and information about how their customers shared content relating to the Client’s events or performances on social media. Our Clients may use and share this information for marketing, operational, analytics and other purposes pursuant to their own respective privacy policies and practices, for which we are not responsible, and that may differ from ours. Our Clients will also have access to any Personal Data collected from their own employees who access and use the administrative tools and features available through our Services together with any records or reports their employees create, and information about how their employees interact with and use those features and tools.
(b) Public Posts and Profile Pictures. Any content you post to public areas of the Services (e.g. the comment section on web pages) is available for public viewing. If you sign in to your Account via SNS and interact with the Services in a public manner (e.g. by publicly RSVP’ing to an event or posting a public comment), your SNS profile picture and link to your SNS profile may be posted on the Services together with a record of your public interaction. Once displayed on publicly viewable web pages, your content can be collected and used by others. We cannot control who reads your postings or what other users may do with the content that you voluntarily post, so it is very important that you do not include Personal Data that you do not want to make public in your posts. Once you have posted information publicly, while you will still be able to edit and delete it on the Services, you will not be able to edit or delete such information after it has been cached, collected, and stored elsewhere by others (e.g., search engines).

We may share your Personal Data with third-party service providers that we or our Clients employ to provide services on our or their behalf, such as to: provide you with the Services; process and fulfill your ticket purchase; conduct quality assurance testing; facilitate creation of accounts; provide technical support; and/or provide other services to Ticketfly or to our Clients. Our service providers are given the information they need to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose personal information for their own marketing or other purposes. Our third-party service providers may be located in jurisdictions outside of the United States or Canada.
