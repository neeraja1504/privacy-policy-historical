Information we collect when you use our Site and Services: We may collect information about the way you interact with our Site, including your computer, browser, and connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from our sites, ad data, IP addresses, telephone calls with us, and standard web log information.  We may obtain information from or about you in other ways. For example, we may verify user information with a service provider or combine your information with information we collect from other companies. Also, we collect the information you send to us such as correspondence, customer satisfaction surveys or customer service communications, testimonials, or user-submitted content such as photos, blogs, and writings. 2.) Third-party login functionality: We allow users with accounts on third-party services, such as Facebook and Google, to log into the Site using functionality that those third parties provide (such as Facebook Connect and Google's OpenID-based authentication mechanism). By using such a functionality to log into the Site, you permit us to access and use specific identifying information related to your third-party account. While these third-party services make a variety of information available, TickPick will only associate your email address or other unique user account identifier with your TickPick account and will not provide the third-party service with any particulars of your TickPick account.  We also allow you to integrate various functionalities from third-party services with TickPick. If you choose to take advantage of this integration feature, we will ask you for your login credentials for the third-party services. By providing those credentials, you are agreeing that we can access and store the information that the third-party site's functionality contains, including personally identifiable information. 3.)

Use of cookies: "Cookies" are small files that reside on your computer and allow us to recognize you as a TickPick.com customer if you return to TickPick.com using the same computer and browser. We use both "session cookies" and "persistent cookies." Session cookies allow us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages in our site during the same session, so that you don't need to re-enter your password multiple times. Once you log out or close your browser, session cookies expire and no longer have any effect. Persistent cookies are stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time and can be easily removed by following your internet browser's "Help" file directions. We use persistent cookies to enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experiences on our site.  How Is the Information Used?

The Security of Your Information TickPick employs various physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to help protect the integrity and security of our systems and to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personally identifiable information that we control. For example, we scramble your password during transmission and limit the employees who can access personally identifiable information to a small set who need such information to perform their jobs. These measures notwithstanding, TickPick is not in a position to guarantee the security of user information, and absolves itself of any responsibility for any security breach that may occur, to the fullest extent of the law. If TickPick learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically, either by email on via our website, so that you can take appropriate protective steps. These methods of communicating with you are only examples. We retain the right to decide which method we will use to notify you of a security breach, and will do so consistent with our legal obligations. Your California Privacy Rights California law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes.
