How we hold and protect your personal information
How we keep your personal information secure
We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be carried out by third parties over encrypted connections using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password or API key which enables you to access certain parts of our site or apps, or you have invited team members to access parts of our site or apps, you are responsible for keeping this password or API key confidential. We ask you not to share a password or API key with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal informtation, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
Our retention of your personal information
The periods for which we keep your information depend on why your information was collected and what we use it for. We will not keep your personal information for longer than necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements.
Some account information will be held for 6 years from your last sign in or use of the service.
We will automatically delete your account after a period inactivity to prevent us holding on to your personal information longer than necessary. We will attempt to contact you by email to warn you prior to deletion. Please check our Terms and Conditions of Service for further details.
Transfer of your personal information
We typically take steps to ensure that we and our service providers do not transfer your personal information outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). However, there may be some circumstances where we do transfer your personal information to a destination outside the EEA, including if we use customer support staff outside the EEA or if you choose to use a certain functionality that is provided by an overseas service provider.
Certain countries outside the EEA have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections to EEA data protection laws and, therefore, no additional safeguards are required to export personal information to these jurisdictions. In countries that have not had these approvals, we will use appropriate safeguards to protect any personal information from being transferred, such as EU Commission-approved model contractual clauses, binding corporate rules or Privacy Shield certification permitted by applicable legal requirements.
Please contact us using the details set out in the “Contact us” section below if you would like to see a copy of the specific safeguards applied to the export of your personal information.
Your rights
You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by unsubscribing from our newsletter and other communications. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at privacy@tickettailor.com.
We will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that your personal information is accurate. In order to assist us, you should notify us of any changes to the personal information that you have provided to us by contacting us at privacy@tickettailor.com.
If you are based in the EEA during your interactions with us (other than for travel purposes), then under certain conditions, you may have the right to require us to: (a) provide you with a copy of the personal information that we hold about you, (b) rectify any inaccuracies in the personal information and complete any incomplete personal information that we process about you, (c) delete personal information we no longer have grounds to process; and (d) restrict how we process your personal information whilst we consider an enquiry you have raised. In certain conditions, you may also have the right to: (a) where processing is based on consent, withdraw your consent; (b) ask us to transmit the personal information you have provided to us to a third party electronically; (c) object to the processing of personal information that we process in certain circumstances; and (d) object to direct marketing (including any profiling for such purposes) at any time.
These rights are subject to certain exemptions to safeguard public interests and our interests and may not be available in the country in which you are based.
If you have the right to do so, you can exercise these rights by contacting us at privacy@tickettailor.com.
If you are not satisfied with our use of your personal information or our response to any exercise of these rights, you have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office.
