The type of information we gather from you
This Privacy Policy explains how we record and use information about you and the choices you can make about how the information is collected and used.
What we do with Personally Identifiable information
We collect information through technology to make our website more interesting and useful to you. For instance, when you come to one of our websites, we collect your IP address. An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our websites. We may combine this information with personally.
Use of Cookies
Our websites also use cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website. We and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For instance, when you return to one of our websites after logging in, cookies provide information to the website so that the website will remember who you are. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Firefox or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your web experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services will not function properly. If you turn off the cookies, some of our services will not function properly and you will not have access to many of the features that make your web experience smoother.

1. If this was clearly stated at the time of collection or registration and, where required, if you have given permission for this.
2. If we employ another organization to perform tasks on our behalf - such as hosting the Site. In this case, the organizations may only use your information to fulfill this specific task.
3. If we sell our business to another organization or merge with other businesses. In this case, the buyer will only be able to use your information as set out in this Privacy Policy.
4. If we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary for legal proceedings. We may also disclose member information when we believe at good faith that applicable law or regulation requires it.
5. If we use third party processors to administer and process for the purposes notified in the Privacy Policy. We may also share details with third parties (such as auditors or legal advisors) to obtain advice. Any such processing will be governed by an agreement in the form required by law, preserving any statutory data protection rights.
