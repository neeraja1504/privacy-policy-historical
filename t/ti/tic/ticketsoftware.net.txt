SITES COVERED BY THIS POLICY
This Privacy Policy applies to TicketNews.com and all internal pages open to public navigation and intended for public use.
TicketNews.com provides links to external and third-party Web sites for the information and convenience of its users. We are not responsible for, nor does this Privacy Policy apply to, the practices or content of those companies or individuals, or the third-party advertisers on TicketNews.com. We encourage our users to read the Privacy Policies of sites linked through TicketNews.com before providing any personal information.
USER INFORMATION: COLLECTION AND USE
We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. TicketNews.com gathers 1.) personally identifiable information (e.g. names, e-mail addresses), and 2.) non-personally identifiable information (e.g. IP addresses, pages viewed).
TicketNews.com only has access to personally identifiable information provided by and with the full consent and intent of the user via on-site submission forms or any user-initiated contact. This information is used only as it relates to the user's intended actions (e.g. registering for a user account, or subscribing to a mailing list). We do not sell or rent this information to anyone.
TicketNews.com also collects non-personally identifiable information regarding user interaction with and navigation of the site. Our third-party Web analytic services are provided via Google Analytics. (Refer to the official Google Privacy Policy for information on their methods of data collection.) This information is used only by TicketNews.com for the purpose of site administration and bettering the services provided to our users. We do not sell or rent this information to anyone.
TicketNews.com will respond to verified law enforcement, or other governmental department requests or subpoenas relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity. In such events, TicketNews.com will disclose information relevant to the investigation. TicketNews.com reserves the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that it believes, in good faith, to be unlawful.
SECURITY
TicketNews.com aims to serve and protect its users against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information. Our servers and information stores are protected by reasonable security measures. Any sensitive information requested on behalf of TicketNews.com for the completion of a merchandise order is handled through a secure processing page operated by PayPal. (Refer to the official PayPal Privacy Policy for details regarding their operation and policies.) Completion of any PayPal-based transaction indicates user acceptance of PayPal's policies.
USER ACCOUNTS
Access to all public content and basic levels of functionality is free and available to all site users. User accounts are also available and allow the creation of an identifying username, but are not mandatory for regular site use. Personal information used in the creation of the user account (e.g. name, e-mail address) remains private and is not visible to other site users.
Upon creating a user account, an account activation e-mail will be sent by TicketNews.com to the address provided by the user. This e-mail includes a one-time password, which the user is asked to change when first logging into the new account. Users retain sole responsibility for creating and maintaining a secure password for their account; a new password may be created under the "Edit" tab of "My Account" when logged in. In the event of a forgotten password, the user may request a new password, which is delivered via automated e-mail and not recorded or filed by TicketNews.com.
Users are free to delete their accounts at any time; the option is available under the "Edit" tab of "My Account." For assistance in deleting an account, contact editorial@ticketnews.com. Please provide the username to be deleted; the e-mail request must originate from the address used to create the account. Accounts deemed to be suspicious, spam, or otherwise harmful to the user in question or the TicketNews.com community as a whole may be deleted at the sole discretion of TicketNews.com and without prior notice.
SUBSCRIPTION E-MAIL SERVICES
TicketNews.com may send daily and weekly newsletters, breaking reports, special promotions and other forms of subscription e-mail to its users. These services are provided free of charge to users who have consented to and provided contact information explicitly for the receipt of e-mail communications from TicketNews.com.
TICKETNEWSFEED WIDGET
TicketNews.com offers, as a convenience, the option to install the TicketNewsfeed Widget on the user's personal Web site, blog, social networking profile or other Internet-based platform. The Widget is hosted by TicketNews.com and presented as-is; its code may not be "hacked" or modified by the user other than via basic color customization options offered on TicketNews.com.
Operation or use of the Widget does not require any input or storage of the user's personal information. The feed employs a non-personal tracking code for general analytic purposes related to overall click-through rates from the Widget's in-bound links to TicketNews.com and its content.
