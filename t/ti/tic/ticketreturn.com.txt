WE VALUE YOUR PRIVACY
Introduction
TicketReturn, LLC develops and licenses software for use by venue and event operators (licensees). All tickets offered for sale on TicketReturn.com are the property of those licensed venue and event operators. All transactions are conducted between you, the purchaser, and the issuing venue or event operator. TicketReturn, LLC, does not own, offer or sell tickets, parking passes, or related items and services.
Collection of Information
Through use of TicketReturn software and services, licensed venue and event operators may collect non-personal and personally identifiable information about visitors and purchasers. For more information about the privacy policies of licensed event and venue operators, please contact the issuing Box Office or visit the organization's website.
Personally identifiable information may include email addresses, as well as names, mailing addresses, payment card type, amount of purchase, and other information required by the payment card industry to authorize cardholder payments. Once an account has been established, a purchaser's userID, password, and security question also are stored. Transactions are referenced by authorization ID numbers, for refund and cardholder/merchant statement purposes. Cardholder Primary Account Numbers (PANs) are truncated to the last 4 digits for secure storage; for added security, payment card expire dates and secondary authorization codes (cvv etc) are not stored.
For your protection, TicketReturn does not support storage of cardholder information sufficient to permit future unauthorized or recurring charges to your account. For each charge, you will be requested to re-enter current cardholder authorization information. We value your security.
