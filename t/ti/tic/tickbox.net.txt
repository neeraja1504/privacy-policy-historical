Tickbox Rewards
Personal Information
We collect basic personal information (Name, Address, Region, DOB, Gender, Marital Status, email address etc.) from you as part of our registration process to enable us set up your Tickbox Rewards account.
In addition we collect information on your preferences when you complete our on-line questionnaire and our polls.
We also collect information on your shopping & online activities with our partners as part of allocating Tickbox Rewards to your account.
From time to time we may also ask for additional personal information as part of a promotion/competition.
Use of Information
By joining the Tickbox Rewards Programme you agree that we can communicate with you with suitable offers from Tickbox Rewards, which may contain opportunities to earn and redeem points as well as to inform you of programme.
You may at any time remove yourself from the Tickbox Rewards programme in which case no additional communication will be sent from Tickbox.net to that particular account and after 30 days any Tickbox Rewards points in that account will be forfeited. Please email: support@tickbox.net.
From time to time we will perform analysis on our member and transaction databases. The results of this analysis may be released to third parties, but only in aggregate form and will contain no personal information at all. We may also use transactional data to update your profile so that we can offer you similar products that maybe of interest to you based on this data.
In accordance with the Data Protection Act, you have a right to access, rectify and delete nominative information concerning you. You can also object to the collection of your personal information for legitimate reasons. If at any time you wish to exercise your rights please send a request by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt along with your username, your email address, your mailing address and your copy of ID to the Tickbox.net address listed on our Contact Us page. Please note that in this circumstance we will be unable to administer your account effectively and it will therefore be closed.
Any confidentiality request that does not contain the username, email address, postal address and a copy of identification of the Member will be systematically rejected.
Tickbox.net cannot be held responsible for any activity in your Tickbox Rewards account that has resulted from a member not keeping their account details secure.
Tell-A-Friend
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Tickbox.net will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Tickbox.net stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact Tickbox.net at www.tickbox.net to request the removal of this information from their database.
Security
This web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, your information is protected both online and off-line.
When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information we do everything in our power to protect user-information online and off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, an account handler or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected log-in screens to gain entry to restricted information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.
Passwords
Access to your account is password protected and we never release details of this to third parties. These details will only be released to the account holder. If you have forgotten your password, please visit the Tickbox.net Home page and follow the "Forgotten your password" link.
Supplementation of Information
In order for this web site to enhance its ability to tailor the site to an individual's preference, we combine information about the preferences and habits of users with similar information from our partners to create personalised user profiles.
Special Offers
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify registration. Established members will occasionally receive information on special deals and promotions. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below.
Site and Service Updates
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their preferences.
Correction/Updating Personal Information
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your postcode), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavour to provide a way to correct or update that user’s personal data provided to us. This can usually be done once logged in members can change their details through the "View/Edit my profile" option or by emailing our Customer Support (support@tickbox.net). If a member wishes to be removed from our mailing list they can do so by emailing our Customer Support (support@tickbox.net).
Choice/Opt-in
Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-in’ to have their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, one of our surveys may have an ‘opt-in’ mechanism so users can receive relevant information or marketing materials from our partners.
Users who no longer wish to receive our promotional materials, or newsletter may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at support@tickbox.net
Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post a note of changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
General
We reserve the right to access and disclose individual information to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests. We also reserve the rights to disclose individually identifiable information to third parties where a complaint arises concerning your use of this web site, where that use does not comply with our terms and conditions
