Data Collection Methods
Automated data collection
We collect data about website visitors (including pre-login data of account users) using our web server logs and third party analytics services such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Segment, and HubSpot.
For example, our web server logs information such as your IP address, internet service provider, the time and duration of your visit on each page on the site, your browser type (including plug-ins), and information about your device, such as the operating system, time zone setting, and language setting. We may place a cookie on your browser to identify you as a return visitor if you visit our site more than once.
Please see How to Opt Out of Online Data Collection below for information on how to block cookies. We use data collected in this way to improve our website and product offerings. For example, we may use data that we collect to help us understand what part of our services offering is of interest to site visitors, or to help us make our site more appealing or easier to use.
Data provided by advertisers
If you arrive at our site by clicking on a link that is part of an advertisement on another site (including an advertisement on a social media platform), the advertising service will identify the link, enabling us to associate you with the advertising parameters we provided to the advertising service.
For example, we may ask an advertising service to target our ad to individuals that the ad service has identified as having a high interest in social media. If you arrive at our site by means of the link in that ad, we will be able to identify you as having a high interest in social media. We use this data to improve our website and product offerings, and to market our services. For example, this information helps us understand if our marketing campaigns are successful so that we can improve our marketing strategy.
See the section below captioned Advertising Ecosystem Data and How to Opt Out of Online Data Collection. Advertising services are responsible for the collection, use and disclosure of the data they provide to us in accordance with their published privacy policies.
Data provided by you as part of your communications with us
We collect personal data that you submit to us as part of a communication with us, such as via chat on our site, email, submission of a web form, telephone, or in person (such as at a meeting, trade show or other event). This may include your name, job title, job function, the organization you represent, email address, phone number, and other personal data that may choose to submit as part of the communication. We use contact information to respond to your communication (such as providing the information or support that you request), and may also use contact information to market our services to you. We may use other personal data included in the communication to improve our site or services, or improve our marketing strategies.
For example, we may use information about your job function or organization to understand who we should communicate with within your organization is a good target for our marketing efforts, or to decide what types of services to market to you or your organization.
Data provided by you or your organization to establish and maintain the TINT account
Our customers are required to name billing, administrative, technical and other types of service and account users who have authority to use our services and manage the customer’s account. We collect the name and business contact information of these account representatives, and will require each individual account representative to establish their own set of account credentials (user name and password). We will use this information to manage the account, such as to send invoices and other account communications, and authenticate individuals who use the services or request information or support on the customer’s behalf. If the customer wishes to integrate their social media accounts with our services, we will require the customer to provide the account credentials used by their representatives on those platforms. We will use those credentials to maintain a live sync between the social media platform and our curation platform as to the social media posts that our customers chooses to manage on our platform.

We have relationships with other companies that help us market, sell and deliver our services, such as event planners. They may provide us with data of the type described above using the methods we describe. We may use that data for the purposes described above.
Combinations of data collected using different methods
We may combine data we collect using any of the methods described above, and use the combined data for the purpose of improving our site and products, marketing our services, or managing our relationship with our customer.
Data Integrity
We process personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Statement. We regularly review our data collection, storage, and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store, and process the minimum personal information needed for the purpose collected.

Processor Data
Our services includes search and filtering tools that help our customers find public social media posts that are relevant to their products, and a dashboard that helps customers curate and manage social media posts as well as other public and non-public media files (such as the customer’s privately generated content).

Advertising Ecosystem
We use online advertising services that enable a practice referred to as “online behavior advertising.” These services aggregate data about an individual’s behavior on many different sites and online services, and use that data to sell targeted advertising services. For example, we permit Google’s advertising services to collect data about your behavior on the TINT site, as do many other website operators who use Google’s ad services. Google combines the data about an individual that it collects from different sources, and uses this aggregate data to sell advertising services that target the display of ads to web users who meet certain behavioral criteria. Google does not disclose this aggregate data to TINT, but we are able to infer that users who interact with our ad meet the advertising criteria we provided. Google collects this data using cookies, web server logs (its own and its advertising customers), clear gifs and other online data collection techniques. See Online Data Collection Techniques and How to Opt Out of Online Data Collection.
Online Data Collection Techniques
A cookie is a unique alphanumeric identifier that is placed by a web server on the web visitor’s browser. Cookies are used to analyse visitors’ use of the website. For example, a website operator can use the cookie to identify the number of unique visitors to the site, whether or not those visitors are repeat visitors, and information about the visitor’s activity on the site, device and device settings. A tracking pixel, also known as a web bug or web beacon, is a small graphic (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) invisible to the eye, that is embedded in web content or email. When content that has an embedded web beacon is viewed, the browser will request content from a web server, which in turn will set a cookie.
How To Opt Out Of Online Data Collection
You can manage browser cookies through your browser settings. The 'Help' feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, how to disable cookies, and when cookies will expire. If you disable all cookies on your browser, neither we nor third parties will transfer cookies to your browser. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some features and services may not work.
Our web server does not recognize or respond to any “do not track” setting you may have in your browser.
