Cookies and Google Analytics
We want you to enjoy visiting our platform, and we use cookies to ensure that our website (www.tiqets.com) runs smoothly and reliably. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. These cookies are placed on your device by your web browser and are either removed each time you close your browser or stored for a longer period of time. Cookies that aren't removed are sent back to us by your web browser the next time you visit. This enables us to recognize your computer or mobile device and improve and personalize your interactions and experiences on the Tiqets website. We also use other tracking technologies that are similar to cookies, such as third party tools, to achieve the same goal.
We strive to not embed cookies with a lifespan longer than one year, although there may be exceptions to this time period. Cookies can be placed on your devices by us or by a third party, such as Google Analytics (Google's official web analytics service). Google Analytics allows us to understand, in aggregate fashion, where visitors land on our website and how they use the site. We cannot disaggregate this data to analyze your individual behavior on our website.
Our website uses technical, functional, analytical and commercial cookies.
Technical cookies – these are necessary to provide the requested service. For instance, technical cookies allow you to proceed through different pages of a website with a single login.
Functional cookies – these cookies help our website and mobile applications "remember" your preferences i.e. language selection, search history and registration information.
Analytics cookies – these cookies are placed by third party service providers, such as Google Analytics, and track how you find and interact with our website or mobile applications.

We can use this information to make our website easier to find, improve your interaction with our platform or measure the impact of our online marketing efforts. We want to point out that these third party service providers may also use information gathered about you on other websites or mobile applications over which we have no control.

Commercial cookies – these cookies are used for tailoring our newsletters to your preferences and personalizing online advertisements. Such personalized adverts can also be shown on other websites you visit. This "retargeting" is based on your browsing activities, such as cultural attractions you're searching for. Commercial cookies can also help prevent the same advertisement continuously reappearing on different sites.
The consent you give us to store and use our and third party cookies can be withdrawn at any time by setting your browser to disable cookies and/or remove all cookies from your browser. However, please take into account that this may limit your access to certain functions and areas on our platform.
