TicketIQ is a secondary ticket marketplace with Low Price Guarantees. Prices are set by the seller and may be above or below face value.
Introduction
This Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) discloses and covers all of the privacy practices of TicketIQ, including as they relate to TicketIQ's website, the related services offered thereon, and any services provided by TicketIQ through its partner websites (collectively, the “Site”). We understand and respect the privacy concerns of our users, and we have made it a critical focus of the Site to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information you provide us. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using the Site, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound to all the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please exit this page and do not access or use the Site.
The Information we Collect
We may collect two types of information: Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”). PII is information that identifies a specific user of the Site. When you engage in certain activities on the Site, such as registering an account or completing a purchase, we may ask you to provide PII about yourself. You do not have to engage in the activities in which we ask you to provide such information. But if you choose to do so, we may ask you to provide certain personal information, such as your first and last name, email address, shipping address, phone number, date of birth, and credit card or other payment information. Depending on what activity you are engaged in, some of the information that we request will be identified as mandatory or as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for an activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.
Non-PII is information that does not identify a specific user. We, our affiliates and independent publishers, with whom we enter into agreements with to use our ticket aggregation and integration platform (our “Publisher Partners”), may automatically collect Non-PII information when you visit the Site, through the use of a variety of tools including cookies (small text files that are stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes and which contains information about that user), web beacons or pixel tags (small graphic images placed on the Site pages and emails that allow the sender or page host us to determine whether you have performed a specific action) or other available data analysis or collection technologies. We may use Non-PII information cookies to show our ads to users on sites across the Internet. Third parties, such as Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's past visits to our website. Visitors can opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting Google's Ads Settings. Alternatively, visitors can opt out of TicketIQ's use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative page or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s self-regulatory program.
How we Use and Share Information

We may share your PII with anyone who performs a function on our behalf, our Publisher Partners, our ticket providers or suppliers for the Site, advertisers, and with any person or entity that has acquired all or any part of our business or assets. We may also share or disclose PII to comply with applicable law, court order or other requirement of a governmental authority, to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy or other agreements, or to protect the rights, property or safety of the Site or other persons. We may share, disclose or sell Non-PII to any person or entity for any purpose.

Other websites, such as our (i) Publisher Partner websites, (ii) websites that you may have clicked-on that directed you to the Site, or (iii) websites that may be accessible to you by clicking-through the Site, have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices.

Editing or Removing Your Profile Information
To the extent we permit you to activate a user profile on the Site, we will permit you to change your profile settings or delete your profile entirely.

Generally, any communication which you post to the Site (whether in chat rooms, discussion groups, message boards or otherwise) is non-confidential. If web pages permit the submission of communications that will be treated by us as confidential, that fact will be stated on those pages.
