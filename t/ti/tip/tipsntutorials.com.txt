Tips 'n' Tutorials does not collect information from its visitors without their knowledge. We may request demographic and poll information but participation is completely optional. Whatever the case, the personal information you supply, if you choose to do so, will not be given out or sold to any third party under any circumstances.
Occasionally we will ask you for personal information, such as your name or email address (for example, to subscribe to one of our mailing lists). This information is never shared or sold to any other company (believe me, we hate spam as much as the next guy).
