In the course of these activities, we are involved in processing your personal data, whether you are a simple visitor or a member.
- In order to respect your privacy and ensure the protection of your data, we comply with the privacy protection regulations in force, including the French Law no. 78-17 dated January 6th 1978, in particular the Law on "Computer Technology and Freedom " and the European Regulation 2016/679 dated April 27th 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, referred to as the "General Data Protection Regulation" or "GDPR".
- We may be led to update this Privacy Policy. Any relevant update shall be previously made known to you and, when it is necessary, it shall be subject to collection of your prior consent.
- Our data protection officer can be contacted at [email protected] or through the postal system: TIPEEE SAS, Protection des données, 20 rue du Sentier, 75002 Paris, FRANCE.
What personal data do we collect and process?
In our capacity as a data controller, we collect and process some of your personal data.
We collect this data, in your capacity as a user of our platform in order to identify you and to contact you (username, full name, email address, postal address, phone), to validate the setting on line of your Creator page (explanatory contents of the Creator pages, Counterparties content, etc.) and to organise the collection of the Tips (banking information).
Furthermore, we collect data related to your use of our services, as well as the browsing data on our websites and our dedicated pages on social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc.). The collected data are necessary to generate audience statistics, to measure the performance, and to carry out business development.
We collect data related to your exchanges with us regarding our services, and the requests that you are presenting to us, especially regarding the management of your rights as well as your instructions in the event of death.
We collect finally the data allowing us to comply with our obligations in the area of combating tax fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing, as well as for the management of your rights, pre-litigations and litigations. Within this framework, we need to collect documents in particular proving your identity (National ID card, Passport, Driving licence, etc.).
All of this information can be communicated to us when you fill out our online forms or within our exchanges. These data can also be collected through software technologies such as cookies. For more information on our use of these tools, we invite you to review the cookie policy available at the following address: Cookies policy.
Concerning the sensitive data
Some data (whether optional or mandatory) that you record via our online forms becomes public and are accessible to everyone. By recording this data, you could reveal your personal data, sometimes sensitive or very personal (religious or philosophical convictions, sexual orientation, political opinions, health status, etc.). Therefore, and as a precaution, we suggest to be careful when entering information in order to protect your privacy.
- Sensitive data accessible from your member profile (when you have created your Tipeee account): username, avatar (graphic illustration), internal messages sent from the website;
- Sensitive data accessible from your Creator page (when you created a Creator page and decided to publish it by activating it): the Creator name, social networks and websites, the Creator page description (including texts, graphic illustrations or any other type of content), counterparties, objectives;
- Sensitive data available in the "News" and "Comments" sections of the Creator page (when the Creator posts a News, when comments are sent via the forms available in the "News" and "Comments" tabs or via the form during the financial subscription): The news title and content (including text, graphic illustrations or any other type of content), content of a comment or answer to a comment.
For your information, when you send a Tip to a Creator, you can decide whether or not to post publicly the comment you make to the Creator when you support him/her financially;
- Sensitive data when sending a financial contribution to a Creator - by default, the Tips (financial contribution) are public and visible from the Tips list on your member profile. Sometimes, the fact to support a Creator may reveal sensitive or very personal data. For example, by supporting a Creator with a political dimension, you indirectly reveal your political opinion. If you would not like your Tip to be public, Tipeee allows you to set your Tip as "anonymous" To do this, you will need to access the administration of your account (in Preferences & notifications). Your identity shall be only known to Tipeee as well as the Creator to whom you sent a Tip.
Concerning the third parties data

You should check that you have the right to communicate such data to Tipeee and to the public (for example by having the written consent of such third parties) and to provide them with the information on the data processing carried out by Tipeee included in this Privacy Policy.
