For example, if you wish to access, correct, amend or delete inaccurate information processed by Tipalti on behalf of its Payor Users, please correct the information on the same website from which it was originally entered by you or contact the relevant Payor directly (as they are the “Controller” of such data). If requested to remove any Payee Personal Information, we will respond to such request within thirty (30) days.
