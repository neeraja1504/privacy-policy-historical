TidBITS Privacy Policy - TidBITS
TidBITS Publishing Inc. takes online privacy seriously. We actively protect the privacy of users of the TidBITS Web site and people who subscribe to our mailing lists.
Collection and Disclosure
In order to provide services, TidBITS collects a variety of personal information, often including, but not limited to, names and email addresses—see below for details about individual TidBITS services. TidBITS will not disclose specific subscriber information to a third party unless required by law.
In the event that TidBITS merges with or is acquired by another company, or sells some or all of our business assets, information covered by this privacy policy may be among the assets transferred. Any acquirer of our assets may continue to utilize your information for the purposes of continuing service, and your data would then be covered by the acquirer’s privacy policy. TidBITS will attempt to ensure that the acquirer’s privacy policy provides a similar level of protection.
Mailing Lists & Email Addresses
To receive TidBITS via email, you must create an account and provide your email address—without it, we can’t send you anything. TidBITS holds the names and email addresses of subscribers in the strictest confidence. TidBITS subscriber databases can be accessed by only a few members of the TidBITS staff and are well protected against theft, tampering, and misuse (electronic or otherwise).
Aggregate information about TidBITS mailing lists (such as the total number of subscribers) may be discussed in TidBITS publications, used to promote TidBITS, or disclosed to sponsors.
If you want to be notified of updates to TidBITS publications on a regular basis without subscribing via email, consider using an RSS news reader and pointing it at our RSS feed.
Web Site Comments
To post a comment on an article via our Discourse-based discussion system, you must register an account on our WordPress site. The name you provide will appear on all of your comments.
TidBITS Membership Program
If you choose to participate in our TidBITS Membership program, we receive and record information related to your contribution, including your name, email address, and contribution amount, but not your credit card number. As with our subscriber databases, this information is held in the strictest confidence. The information can be accessed by only a few members of the TidBITS staff and is well protected against theft, tampering, and misuse (electronic or otherwise).
If you have chosen to list your name and a URL to a Web page of your choice, that information appears on our public TidBITS Members page. Also appearing on that page is aggregate information about the number of members.
If you asked us to remind you to renew, we will send you email reminders at the appropriate time. We may also send you email to aid in resolving problems relating to a membership or to communicate with you about other issues related specifically to members.
TidBITS membership order processing is handled for TidBITS by Stripe, through the Paid Memberships Pro plug-in for WordPress. To process your payment, Stripe collects information including contact information and credit card number. Use of that information is governed by Stripe’s privacy policy.
Web Server Usage
TidBITS records information about how people access our Web sites. This information includes your IP address (or the DNS name associated with it) and what Web browser you’re using.
We also record information about queries submitted to TidBITS search facilities to better understand how people use our search features. As with other Web accesses, this information generally cannot be associated with any particular user; in any case, query information is not disclosed to anyone outside the TidBITS staff.
Unsubscribing and Account Removal
If you wish to unsubscribe from the weekly TidBITS email issue, you can do so in your account. Similarly, if you wish to stop receiving email from our Discourse-based discussion forums, you can do that in your account’s preferences in Discourse. If you have trouble with either process, or if you wish to have your account(s) removed entirely, contact us.
Editorial Mail
Email messages sent to TidBITS editorial addresses are considered public statements and become the property of TidBITS Publishing Inc. Unless noted otherwise in the message itself, TidBITS may publish such messages (including the author’s name and email address) in whole or in part on TidBITS Web sites and/or in TidBITS publications. TidBITS will generally try to contact correspondents before any such publication but makes no guarantee to do so. TidBITS will honor any request not to publish a message or not to publish the correspondent’s name or email address.
Discussion Lists & Archives
Along with article comments, our Discourse-based discussion system can be configured by individual users to work like a mailing list. Although account information is maintained in the strictest confidence (see above), participating in discussions may reveal information such as your name and email address. This information could be collected by a third party. Additionally, you should consider any discussion list a public forum, and exercise caution in disclosing any personal information.
Surveys
TidBITS may give readers the opportunity to participate in surveys on occasion. In all cases, participation will be voluntary. If a survey asks for personal information, answering those questions will be optional.
External Links
TidBITS Web sites and publications contain numerous links to other Internet sites. TidBITS cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other organizations or the content of external Web sites.
