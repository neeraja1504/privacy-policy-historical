California Do Not Track Disclosures (Automatically Collected Information)
Like most website operators, we collect information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as your IP address, your browser type, information regarding your internet service provider or the type of device you used to access this website, language preference, pages visited, and the date and time of each page request. Some of this information may be considered Personal Data under applicable laws.  Some of this data may also be sent to third-party content providers (for example: advertisers, website analytic companies, etc.) that provide content on our Services. Such sharing may allow the website and/or content providers to track you over time and across multiple websites. At this time, our site does not respond to Do Not Track beacons sent by browser plugins as there is not yet a common agreement about how to interpret Do Not Track signals from browsers. Additionally, if you navigated from or navigate to other websites from our site, we may collect the address of those websites.
We may collect information about your activities on this site through the use of cookies, clear gifs or web beacons, local shared objects or Flash cookies, or through other identifiers or technologies, including similar technologies as they may evolve over time. We refer to these technologies collectively as Data Technologies. We use Data Technologies to help us identify and track visitors, their usage of our Services, and their website access preferences.
We may allow third parties to use Data Technologies on our site. The information collected from these Data Technologies may be shared with and used by us, by others acting on our behalf, or by third parties. Information collected by Data Technologies may be used on this website or on other websites, services, or online applications, including websites that may not be operated by us. For example, we may partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. These ad-network partners use Data Technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. These websites and third-party ad networks are not controlled by us.
You may be able to restrict our use of certain Data Technologies, such as cookies, by modifying your browser settings. For example, your web browser may enable you to refuse cookies. By restricting our use of Data Technologies, certain features of our Services may not function properly.
