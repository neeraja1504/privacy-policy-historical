Information We Gather
The information we gather falls into two categories: 1) personal information you voluntarily supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for an online discussion, enter a contest or provide your e-mail address, and 2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites. More.
Use of Information
If you have registered online to one of our sites, The New York Times will not sell, rent, swap or authorize any third party to use your e-mail address without your permission. This also applies to any information that personally identifies you, except as noted immediately below. We do, however, share information about our audience in aggregate form. For example, we may want to know how long the average reader spends on our site, or which pages or features get the most attention.
If you are a print subscriber to The New York Times newspaper and subscribed either by mail, phone or online, we may exchange or rent your name and mailing address (but not your e-mail address) with other reputable companies that offer marketing information or products through direct mail. If you prefer that we do not share this information, you may opt-out.
NYTimes.com may share personal information with The New York Times Company for analysis purposes. NYTimes.com will not share personal information about you as an individual to third parties without your consent.
The New York Times may perform statistical analyses of subscribers and their subscribing and purchasing patterns for product development purposes and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our subscriber base.
We may use demographic and preference information to allow advertising on our Web sites to be targeted, in aggregate, to the users for whom they are most pertinent.
We contract with other companies to provide services on our behalf, including credit-card and billing processing, shipping, e-mail distribution, list processing and analytics or promotions management.
Any information you disclose when posting to a message board, along with your message board screen name or ID, becomes public and may be used by The New York Times for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media.
More.

If, at any time, you prefer not to receive e-mail marketing information from us, simply follow the unsubscribe options at the bottom of each e-mail. For more information on how to unsubscribe from e-mail marketing, click here.

We encourage you to read our complete Privacy Policy. The full New York Times Privacy Policy contains links to supplementary information about specific New York Times sites or services. We reserve the right to update our Privacy Policy.
Our Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time. Any such changes will be posted on our main Privacy Policy page. If we make a significant or material change in the way we use your personal information, the change will be posted thirty (30) days prior to taking effect and registered users will be notified via e-mail.
We employ measures designed to protect the security of your personal identifying information. More.
