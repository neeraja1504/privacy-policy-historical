Privacy Policy
We believe your private information should be just that, private. Clearly, to operate our services we need to collect some personal information about you. This policy explains what we do and why we do it.
What we collect
We ask for your name and email address when you signup to our service. This is our primary mechanism to identify you.
How we store the information
We take great care to keep your personal information safe, all our live services and databases operate from computers that are housed in secure data centres with heavily restricted access. We operate numerous levels of security to prevent unauthorised access to those computers including firewalls and passwords.
What we do with the information
Email is a vital part of Timetastic, emails are used to communicate time off requests and confirmations to users. We don’t allow users to opt out of these emails. We also use email to send occasional alerts, reminders and newsletters in relation to Timetastic and how you use Timetastic, all these emails contain a link that allows a user to opt out of further communication with a single click.
