Civ. Code 1798.140(o).  To the extent that any other provision of this Privacy Policy conflicts a provision of this section, the provision in this section controls as to California residents.

California residents may submit a Right to Know Request through Settings in the Application or by emailing Timehop at privacy@timehop.com.  California residents may submit two types of Right to Know Requests: (1) A Request for the specific pieces of information that Timehop has collected about you in the past twelve months; or (2) a Request for the categories of Personal Information that Timehop has collected about you in the past twelve months, and how Timehop has used and disclose that information.  When you submit a Right to Know Request, we may ask you to provide certain pieces of information in order to verify your identity, such as your name, email address, and phone number.  We may also use a third-party identity verification service to attempt to verify your identity.

“RIGHT TO OPT-OUT” REQUESTS
California residents may opt out of the sale of some or all of their Personal Information by clicking the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link located in Settings in our Application or by emailing Timehop at privacy@timehop.com.  You may be required to provide certain information to verify your identity.  We will only use that information for purposes of processing the Request.

Not sell your Personal Information unless and until you subsequently provide express authorization for the sale of your Personal Information.
Notify all third parties to whom we have sold your Personal Information within 90 days prior to our receipt of your Request that you have exercised your Right to Opt-Out, and instruct them not to further sell your Personal Information.

If a Request or series of Requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee for processing the Request(s), or may refuse to process the Request(s).
AUTHORIZED AGENTS
California residents may submit Right to Know, Right to Opt-Out, and Right to Delete Requests through an authorized agent.  Unless the agent provides Timehop with a power of attorney executed by the California resident, Timehop may require the California resident to verify their identity with Timehop and/or to provide Timehop with written confirmation of the agent’s authority to make the request.
