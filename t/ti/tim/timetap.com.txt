General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new European Union (EU) privacy law that goes into effect on 25th May 2018. This new privacy law will replace the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive (DPD).
Its objective is to improve the protection of the personal data of EU citizens and ensure that organizations that collect, store and process Personally Identifiable Information (PII) – such as email addresses or phone numbers – operate in a well-defined framework. PII is any data that used alone or with other data can be used to identify a person.

Please reach out to our team if you have any question on how this affects the data held by TimeTap via support@timetap.com or 202-753-7351.
User Consent
The purpose of the GDPR is to ensure that businesses, like TimeTap, have a legal basis to process Personal Data. TimeTap will do this by asking users for their consent and this consent must be specific and verifiable.
This means that a written record of consent must be kept and tied to specific users. It also means that this consent can be removed/taken away at any time and as a result businesses have to delete the PII from their records.
Consent also has to be unambiguous and clearly explain what the user is agreeing to. As an example, any form that has pre-checked consent boxes on it are not accepted by this new law.
Data Subject Rights
The new GDRP EU regulation clearly defines the rights of the data subjects, meaning the person whose data is held by a business. EU citizens will have the right to ask for information regarding how their data is processed, used and stored. In addition, they are able to request their data to be handled in a specific manner. As an example, they have the ability to control where their data is hosted.
Whatever the reasons they have the right to request their data to be corrected, amended or even deleted. They also have the right to access that data and the company they use hosts check with personal data.
This means that the data processors need to be clear on how they process data – including the different third party services they might be using – and be ready to support user requests in a timely manner.
Use of Cookies
The TimeTap website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server.
