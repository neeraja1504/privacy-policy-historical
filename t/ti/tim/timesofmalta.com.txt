What if you choose not to give personal information?
We may need to collect personal information by law, or under the terms of a contract, we have with you.
If you choose not to give us this personal information, it may delay or prevent us from meeting our obligations. It may also mean that we cannot perform services needed to run your subcription. It could mean that we cancel a product or service you have with us.
Any data collection that is optional would be made clear at the point of collection.
The measures taken to protect your personal information
We use a range of physical, electronic and managerial measures to ensure that we keep your personal data secure, accurate and up to date. These measures include:
* education and training to relevant staff to ensure they are aware of our privacy obligations when handling personal data;
* administrative and technical controls to restrict access to personal data on a ‘need to know’ basis;
* technological security measures, including firewalls, encryption and anti-virus software;
* physical security measures, such as staff security passes to access our premises.
Although we use appropriate security measures once we have received your personal data, the transmission of data over the Internet (including by e-mail) is never completely secure. We endeavour to protect personal data, but we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to us or by us.

1. as long as you are a customer of Allied Newspapers Limited;
2. any retention period that is required by law;
3. the end of the period in which litigation or investigations might arise in respect of the product and services.
After you stop being a customer, we may keep your data for periods of time as allowed by law for one of those reasons:
* To respond to any questions or complaints;
* To show that we treated you fairly;
* To maintain records according to rules that apply to us;
* To comply with obligations that we may have at law;
* In order to protect our legitimate interests, in which case we make sure that this does not override your fundamental privacy rights at law.
