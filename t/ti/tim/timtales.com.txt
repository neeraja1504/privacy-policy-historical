Privacy Policy | Timtales by Tim Kruger
This privacy policy declares in an easy and not too technical way what kind of data is collected and tracked at Timtales.com when you interact with the site.
Data collection and purpose
When you purchase a membership our billing providers Epoch.com and Segpay.com will gather the payment information you provide so the purchase can be processed. They are using the latest technology to protect your data. Please refer to the privacy statements of www.Epoch.com or www.Segpay.com for more information.
After a signup for a membership the billing providers Epoch or Segpay will disclose some of the information they gathered from you to us at Timtales. This information contains your email address, your name, your join country and postal code, the membership type you purchased and the payment method you used.
It does NOT contain any exact address and it does NOT contain your credit card number, bank account number or any other specific bank details.
We use the information provided by the billing companies only if there is a problem with your membership or your login or if you contact us for support. We guarantee that we will NOT rent, sell, or share personal information about you with any third party, except when required by law, like by a subpoena or court order.
There is also information we collect and save on our own server when you interact with the site. When your reach the site as a visitor, we record which site you have visited before. This helps us to determine if a banner that we placed on a partner site brought you to us or maybe some posts we made on social media.
When you login to your membership account we record your IP address and date and time of your access. Also we see which pages and videos you view and the amount of data you download.
We also see the browser and operating system that you use to view our content.
We do this to diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the website. Also it helps gather general demographic information that helps us improve our product. Example: By recording which operating system our members use we had learned that we had to improve our site for use on mobile devices like iPhone and Android phones.
Furthermore, we place cookies in our members area. They are necessary to manage your online session. Example: The cookie tells the system that your are still logged in whenever you watch another video. Otherwise you would get the login dialogue over and over again when you watch or download multiple videos. Also, cookies tell us which videos you have saved as favourites in your account, so you find them again in your “my favourites” page whenever you login. You can set your browser not to accept cookies. However, then the site will not function properly. You can also delete cookies in your browser after a session on a website. That will be no problem for your next online session.
And finally, we use Google Analytics to get information about our site statistics. The information that Google uses for that cannot be used to identify you personally. It is general information that shows things like: What is the time when we have the most site visitors, Where do the visitors come from, How many visitor do we have on a specific day.
This kind of statistic information guides us to make the necessary adjustments to our site and our content to make the user experience more pleasurable and bring our hot videos to more people all around the world.
