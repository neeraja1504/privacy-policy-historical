ALSO… IMAGE POLICY
I love it when you love my work! You may use any of my photos or recipes from a post you enjoy here to be featured on your site, as long as you provide a link back to me and notify me either in the comments or with a direct email. If you feature a photo, it may not be accompanied by the project tutorial, whether in my own words as it originally appears or paraphrased. I do not permit photos of my family to be shared without my express written consent for each photo used.
I know that by publishing on the internet, anyone can see what I share, but it’s still my intellectual property and it only belongs here at TitiCrafty unless you get prior written permission from me for each post.
