Your Privacy
Title Nine values our customers and respects your privacy. We collect information about you on our website in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about orders, services and products. This policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.
What Personal Information does Title Nine collect?
When you place an order with us we collect your name, address, email address, telephone number and credit card information. If you ask to be placed on our email list, we will collect your name and email address.
In addition to personal information we may collect and use non-personally identifiable information (such as click behavior, browser type, time and date) during your visit to our websites and others to deliver more relevant advertising likely to be of greater interest to you. You may visit the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance to learn more about interest-based advertising or to opt out of receiving advertisements tailored to your interests on your browser from their participants. Note that electing to opt out will not prevent ads from appearing, but it may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests.

How do we use your email address?
We use your email to communicate all kinds of Customer Service information. We use your email to:
Send you immediate confirmation of your order
Send you confirmation when your order ships
Send you information when your backorder ships
Send you confirmation that we received your return
Additionally, we will notify you of new products and upcoming sales and events, such as web-only specials, speakers, book signings and events that are of interest to women involved with sports. What we DON'T use it for is anything else. We don't sell or rent your email address to anyone. No partners, no manufacturers, no other lists. No fooling.

Mailing Lists
How do mailing lists work?
It's one of those unavoidable truths in the mail order business. We need to rent or exchange names with other like-minded businesses in order to stay in business and grow. What that means is, chances are, if our catalog just arrived out of nowhere in your mailbox, we probably rented your name from another company. Or we may have exchanged some of our buyers' names for some of another company's buyers' names.

How do I prevent my name from being exchanged with other companies?

Safety & Security
Is it safe for me to shop online at titlenine.com?
Your online orders at Title Nine are just as safe as any other credit card purchase that you'll ever make. We use a sophisticated encryption technology to keep your credit card information safe while you're shopping online. So whether you're buying at a retail store, through a mail order catalog or online at Title Nine, your transactions will all have the same high standards for security.
At Title Nine we use SSL (Secure Socket Layering) 128 bit encryption to protect your information as it travels over the internet. We also hold a secure key, or digital certificate, through Digital Signature Trust. This key ensures that we are who we say we are and that any data exchanged online is protected from theft and tampering. Consumer protection laws protect you against any unauthorized use of your credit card. Federal law dictates that your legal liability is limited to $50 if your credit card number is used without your permission. If you suspect any illegal use of your card, call your issuing bank immediately to make sure your rights are protected.
