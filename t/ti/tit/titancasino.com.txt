Our Privacy Statement
PRIVACY POLICY for www.titancasino.com and related mobile applications (" Website ").
This Privacy Policy is effective from 25 May 2018. We may change this Privacy Policy at any time, and if we do so will post the changes to this page as well as the date that the changes take effect.
This policy is made compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (the “ GDPR ”), (Regulation (EU) 2016/679).
Our Privacy Policy below sets out in detail how we process your personal data, and we encourage and recommend that you read it in full. We understand that people have busy lives though, and so wanted to help you by providing a brief overview of how and
why we process your personal data.
In general, we will only collect the personal data that we need from you to offer you our services. For example, if you want to gamble with us then we'll collect your name, username, contact details, date of birth and address in order to set you up with
an account. We’ll process data on any games that you play so that we can identify if you have won and, of course, pay any winnings to you.
The other main reason we will process your personal data is to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations. As you may know, in order to provide you with gambling services, we are required to have a licence. As such, we will need to comply with our
licence, and this may involve us collecting additional information about you.
Ultimately, we aim to only process your personal data where it is necessary. We will always keep your personal data secure. Your enjoyment of our services and your safety are our primary concerns.
