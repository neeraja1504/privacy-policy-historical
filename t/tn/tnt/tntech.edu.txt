FERPA Rights to Privacy
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.
FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are "eligible students."
The law grants four specific rights to students:
the right to see the information that an institution has concerning a student
the right to seek an amendment to those records and, in certain cases, to append a statement to the record
the right to consent for disclosure of those records
the right to file a complaint with the Department of Education Compliance Office in Washington, D.C.
For more information on FERPA, please see the Department of Education web site.
Privacy Policy Changes and Maintenance
The University Privacy Policy is maintained by the Web and Digital Media Director in the Office of Public Affairs. The University has the right to change this policy at any time. All official changes will be posted via the web site. This statement is effective as of January 1, 2008.
