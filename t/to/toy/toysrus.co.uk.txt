Privacy & Cookie Policy | Toys R Us – Toys R Us (UK)
For the Joint Administrators'  Privacy Policy please refer directly to their website: https://www.moorfieldscr.com/privacy-policy/
At Toys R Us we are committed to protecting your privacy and we comply with the data protection laws applicable to the UK. This Privacy Policy outlines how your personal information is treated and forms part of our Terms and Conditions. (We may occasionally modify our Privacy Policy; when this happens we will notify you via our terms and conditions page.)
For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”), the data controller is Toys “R” Us Limited of Geoffrey House, Maidenhead Office Park, Westacott Way, Maidenhead SL6 3QH.
What information do we collect?
When you order we need to know your name, e-mail address, delivery address, credit/debit card number and expiry date. This allows us to process and fulfil your order and notify you of your order status. We also ask you for your telephone number(s) so we can contact you easily if required. Additionally, we request that you confirm your date of birth, enabling us to control the sale of age restricted items, such as video games, through our website.
You may give us other information about you when you correspond with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise.
How do we use your information?
Any personal data relating to you will be used and recorded by us in accordance with current data protection legislation and this Privacy Policy. We use the information collected from you to process orders and to provide a more personalised shopping experience. We may use your personal information to communicate with you, for record keeping purposes, and in aggregate (and therefore anonymously) for market research purposes, to track activity on our site, to publish trends and/or to improve the usefulness of content.
We may use other companies to provide services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customers’ questions about products or services, sending postal mail and e-mails, analysing data and processing credit card payments. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. We may also share your information with credit reference agencies for the purpose of accessing your credit score.
We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others unless you have consented to us making your name and address available to carefully vetted companies.
Where we store your personal data?
The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, amongst other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try and prevent unauthorised access.
In addition...
We would also like to send you offers for goods or services from our company or others from time to time which we think you may find of interest. If you do not wish to receive this information, do not tick the opt-in box on our checkout page before submitting your order.
Acess to Infomation
The Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.
