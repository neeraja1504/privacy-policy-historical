1. What does this "R" Us Family Privacy Policy cover?
The "R" Us Family includes Toys "R" Us, Inc.; Babiesrus.com, LLC; Toys "R" Us (Canada) Ltd.; and their affiliates (collectively, the ""R" Us Family members" or the ""R" Us Family").
This Privacy Policy outlines "R" Us Family practices regarding personal information collected (a) on our corporate website online at www.toysruscanada.ca or www.toysrusinc.ca (the ""R" Us Site"); (b) online at www.toysrus.ca, www.babiesrus.ca, www.babies-r-us.ca, www.babiesruscanada.ca, www.kidsrus.ca, www.kids-r-us.ca, www.giftsrus.ca, www.sportsrus.ca, www.imaginarium.ca, www.rzone.ca, www.rzonecentral.ca, www.mybabiesrus.ca and any other websites and/or apps operated by Toys "R" Us (Canada) Ltd. (collectively, the "Online Store") (the "R" Us Site and the Online Store referred to collectively as "our websites"); (c) when you call, e-mail or otherwise communicate with Toys "R" Us (Canada) Ltd., including at our call centers; and (d) at Toys "R" Us retail stores in Canada (the "Retail Stores"). Nothing in this Privacy Policy, or otherwise, will create, or add to, any right or claim (whether legal, equitable or otherwise) that any individual or person may have at law, or otherwise, against any of the "R" Us Family members' respective directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives (collectively, the "'R" Us Family Representatives"); nor will the existence of this Privacy Policy or its application impose any obligations or liability upon the "R" Us Family Representatives, or add to any such obligation or liability, that the "R" Us Family Representatives do not already otherwise have to any individual or person at law or otherwise.
YOUR CONSENT
BY SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE "R" US FAMILY MEMBERS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE SERVICE PROVIDERS OR AGENTS VIA OUR WEBSITES OR AT THE RETAIL STORES, OR THROUGH OTHER INTERACTIONS WITH US AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 2 BELOW, YOU CONSENT TO OUR COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND AS PERMITTED OR REQUIRED BY LAW.
If you provide us with personal information concerning another individual, you represent and warrant that you have all necessary authority and/or have obtained all necessary consents from such individual to enable us to collect, use and disclose such personal information for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy.
Subject to legal and contractual requirements and reasonable notice, you may withdraw your consent at any time; however, without such consent, "R" Us Family members may limit the services or products they are able to provide to you. You may also withdraw your consent for:
Mail marketing, Telephone marketing and Quality control communications. You may decide that you prefer that "R" Us Family members not use your personal information to promote new and/or additional products and services which may be of interest to you and refuse that an "R" Us Family member contact you by mail or telephone for marketing purposes or by email or telephone for quality control purposes. If this is the case, you may advise us by calling 1-866-345-5656 and asking for assistance through a customer service representative.
Commercial Electronic Messages. You can always limit commercial electronic messages that "R" Us Family members send to you. To opt-out of commercial electronic messages, simply click the link labeled "unsubscribe" at the bottom of any email that a "R" Us Family member sends to you, follow the other instructions provided or call 1-866-345-5656 and ask for assistance through a customer service representative. Please note that even if you opt-out of these promotional communications, the "R" Us Family may still need to contact you with important information about a purchase made from the "R" Us Family.
Once you withdraw your consent, your personal information may be retained in the "R" Us Family database to ensure that we honour your privacy requests to opt-out of certain communications and for record-keeping purposes.
2. What information do we collect?
As used in this Privacy Policy, "personal information" is information about an identifiable individual, as defined in privacy laws applicable to the "R" Us Family. Personal information does not include aggregated information that does not allow an individual to be identified. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, information regarding your children that you (the parent) provide to the "R" Us Family is treated in the same manner as information collected about you. Please see Section 3 below for further information regarding children's privacy.
(a)     Information You Give Us
The "R" Us Family members collect personal information (including, without limitation, names, addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses) that you provide when you: (i) visit the Online Store and the Retail Stores; (ii) create or edit your Registries and Wish Lists; (iii) register your R Club card or otherwise participate in the R Club loyalty program; (iv) participate in a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion; (v) sign up for and/or fill out a survey or questionnaire; (vi) sign-up for email and/or SMS news and alerts (or other commercial electronic messages); (vii) contact an "R" Us Family member (by email or otherwise); (viii) contact an "R" Us Family customer service representative; (ix) otherwise interact with an "R" Us Family member; or ( x) provide product reviews and/or feedback.
(b)     Automatic Information Collection
Each time you visit the "R" Us Site or the Online Store, the web server automatically collects certain types of information, including your Internet service provider's address, your Internet protocol or IP address, the web page from which you logged in, your web browser software, the language settings on your web browser, and a record of your activity while visiting the "R" Us Site or the Online Store. "R" Us Family members may use cookies, pixel tags, browser analysis tools, server logs, web beacons and other similar technologies that allow us to know if a particular web page was visited, an email opened, links in the email utilized or if the advertisements on the "R" Us Site or Online Store were effective. In some instances, these technologies may allow us to match activities with particular users. Please see Sections 8 and 9 below for further information about such technologies.
While using "R" Us Family apps, including the Play Chaser app, we will collect unique device identifiers and information concerning the game activities and usage of the app in connection with such unique device identifier, in order to be able to operate and improve the app. However, this information cannot identify you as an individual since the "R" Us Family does not have the capacity to link, combine or match such information with other personal information of an app user.
3. Children's Privacy
The "R" Us Site, Online Store and Retail Stores do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children under the age of 13. We encourage parents of children under the age of 13 to regularly check and monitor their children's use of e-mail and the "R" Us Family websites.
4. How do we use and share your personal information?
Using Your Personal Information
The "R" Us Family members collect, use and disclose personal information in accordance with applicable privacy laws and regulations.
Your personal information may be used by the "R" Us Family members and their agents and service providers: (a) to administer and enhance your guest and/or customer relationship with us, including to administer accounts, maintain gift registries, Wish Lists, R Club cards and the R Club loyalty program, to book Baby Registry or other appointments with a "R" Us Family member, monitor customer refunds, facilitate deliveries, administer our customer service centre, make and receive payments, and fulfill contractual obligations; (b) to understand your needs and preferences, respond to your requests and follow-up on, respond to and settle any complaints or inquiries you may have regarding our products, stores and/or services; (c) subject to your right to opt-out of such advertising (please refer to Section 9), to tailor offerings to you by delivering to you or allowing you to see certain advertising based on your interests, searches you perform, information you provide at the Retail Store, on the "R" Us Site or Online Store or your activity on our websites or other websites; (d) subject to your right to withdraw consent for such purposes, to communicate with you about products, services, special offerings and events or programs offered by the "R" Us Family members or their marketing partners that may be of interest to you; (e) subject to your right to withdraw consent for such purposes, to conduct surveys, contests and promotions; (f) to conduct research and statistical analysis; (g) to monitor communications to ensure the consistency and quality of the products and services of the "R" Us Family and its suppliers, distributors and other third parties with whom we have a commercial relationship; (h) to manage and develop the "R" Us Family businesses and operations; (i) to detect and protect the "R" Us Family and other third parties against error, negligence, breach of contract, theft, fraud and other illegal activity; (j) to comply with the "R" Us Family audit requirements, and to audit compliance with laws and the "R" Us Family corporate policies, procedures and contractual obligations; (k) to engage in due diligence and carry out business transactions that may involve the purchase, sale, lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal, securitization or financing involving an "R" Us Family member; (l) as permitted by, and to comply with, applicable laws and regulations; and (m) for any other purpose to which you consent.
Only "R" Us Family Representatives who require your personal information in the performance of their duties will have access to your personal information. Notably, only "R" Us Family Representatives in the customer service department, who process online purchases, may have access to your credit card information.
Sharing Your Personal Information
"R" Us Family members will not license, sell or provide your personal information to any third party except as permitted by this Privacy Policy, as permitted or required by law, or with your consent. In addition to the purposes described above, the "R" Us Family shares your personal information as set forth below:
With "R" Us Family Members. Personal information collected by one member of the "R" Us Family will be used by that member in accordance with this Privacy Policy and may be shared with other "R" Us Family members for use only as permitted by law.
With Our Agents and/or Service Providers. "R" Us Family members may share your personal information with agents and service providers who provide services for, or administer activities on behalf of, the "R" Us Family (such as, but not limited to, authorization of credit card transactions, order fulfillment and delivery, sweepstakes, website maintenance and contests, marketing, advertising, data processing and storage, information technology and office services, auditors and professional advisors, and co-branded or joint product and service promotions). These agents and/or service providers are granted access to some or all of your personal information as necessary in order to provide the service and may use cookies and other automatic collection technologies (as described in further detail in Section 8 below) on our behalf. "R" Us Family members strive to protect personal information rendered accessible to agents and service providers by using contractual and other measures to restrict them from using your personal information in any manner other than as may be necessary to perform their mandate and/or services. We may also utilize agents and/or service providers to assist us in aggregating personal information. We may then share such aggregated information (but not personal information) with prospective marketing partners and advertisers.
In Connection with Business Transactions. In the event that a store, division or part or all of an "R" Us Family member (or the assets of one of those entities) is bought, sold, otherwise transferred or financed, or is in the process of a potential transaction, personal information may need to be disclosed under confidentiality restrictions to perform due diligence reviews. If the transaction proceeds, such personal information may be used and disclosed by the successor entity, provided such use and disclosure is in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If the transaction does not proceed, the "R" Us Family will require the potential purchaser not to use or disclose customer personal information, in any manner whatsoever, and to return or destroy such information.
To Comply with Laws and Protect Against Loss. A "R" Us Family member may also disclose your personal information when it determines that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable laws, and/or to detect and protect the "R" Us Family and other third parties against error, negligence, breach of contract, theft, fraud and other illegal activity, to comply with the "R" Us Family audit requirements, and to audit compliance with laws and the "R" Us Family corporate policies, procedures and contractual obligations, to the extent permitted by law. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, credit risk reduction, debt collection, insurance coverage and in the course of investigating and resolving disputes and litigation.
On Registries and Wish Lists. Registries and Wish Lists are made available for viewing by others. If you create your Registry or Wish List in a Retail Store, your information may be accessible at the Online Store. If you create your Registry or Wish List at the Online Store, your Registry information will also be accessible at the Retail Stores.
5. How is your personal information protected?
The "R" Us Family members use industry-standard security techniques on our websites to help protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information collected from you at our websites. When you access your account information or transmit personal information to our websites, that information is stored on servers that our websites have attempted to secure from unauthorized access or intrusion. "Secure Socket Layer" software encrypts personal information you transmit to our websites. The "R" Us Family members cannot be and are not responsible for unauthorized access to information by hackers or others who have obtained such access through illegal measures.
"Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an email that looks like it might be from a "R" Us Family member asking for your personal information, do not respond. The "R" Us Family members would not request your password, user name, credit card information, or other personal information through email.
