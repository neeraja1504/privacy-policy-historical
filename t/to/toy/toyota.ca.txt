Non-Personally Identifiable Information. When you visit TCI’s web sites, unless you tell TCI who you are or reveal any other personal information, TCI does not collect or store any information about you. The only information TCI collects and stores is non-personally identifiable information such as the name of your Internet service provider, the type of the Internet browser you used, and referring web site and the pages you request. TCI uses this non-personally identifiable information to generate aggregate statistics regarding TCI’s web site activity.
Cookies.

You may choose to decline to accept cookies if your browser permits but doing so may affect your use of TCI’s web sites and your ability to access certain features of the web sites.
Pixel tags. A pixel tag is a transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon, clear GIFs or tracking beacon, placed on a web site or in an e-mail, which indicates to us that a page or e-mail has been viewed. In addition, a pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server.
Third-Party Links. TCI’s web sites contain links to other sites. When you click on links that take you to third party web sites, you will be subject to the third parties' privacy policies. While TCI supports the protection of privacy on the Internet, TCI is not responsible for the actions of third parties or for their privacy practices.

Advertising/Behavioral Targeting; How To Opt-Out
TCI licenses technology to serve advertisements on its own web sites and within its content as that content is served across the Internet.
Ad network providers, data providers, publishers and other media-related companies, and/or analytics service providers may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device’s web browser and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you. We and they may use information about your browsing behavior on one or multiple devices to establish an online profile and to target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based on your visits to both the TCI web sites and other web sites. We and they may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements.
If you prefer not to allow TCI to use these technologies to collect or use your personal information for the purposes of targeted advertising on TCI’s web sites, you may opt-out by clicking here. If you prefer not to allow TCI, or third parties acting on TCI’s behalf, to use these technologies to collect or use your personal information for purposes of targeted advertising on third-party websites, you may opt-out by following the procedure on the NAI Opt-Out Page.
These opt-outs will not be effective if your browser is configured to reject cookies, or if you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change browsers.
In addition, TCI may use third-party ad networks, publishers and other entities to serve advertisements and third party analytics vendors to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the TCI web sites and viewing of our content. For example, we may share personal information with third parties (e.g., social media sites, other advertisers, advertising agencies, advertising networks, data exchanges, etc.) in order to deliver to you content on our website or third party sites. For information about your ability to opt-out of this, please contact us at socialmedia@toyota.ca
Please note that even if you opt-out, you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests. Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.
