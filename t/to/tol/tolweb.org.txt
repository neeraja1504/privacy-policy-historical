Tree of Life Privacy Statement
The Tree of Life (ToL) Project is committed to respecting the privacy of those who visit the ToL website and those who contribute materials to the project or participate in discussions administrated by the project. Please review the ToL Privacy Policy set forth below so that you can understand your options in using the Tree of Life website and its services.
The ToL is a not-for-profit project and does not engage in e-commerce. The ToL does not sell or rent any information about its visitors or contributors to third parties, and we do not contact visitors or contributors to promote or sell any product.
What This Privacy Policy Covers
This privacy policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (e.g. first and last names, email address, a home or physical address, a telephone number, institution or affiliation) that the ToL Project may hold. You can visit the ToL website without identifying who you are, or revealing personally identifiable information.
Any personally identifiable information the ToL obtains about a contributor or visitor is information supplied voluntarily as part of using the website or signing up for a particular service or activity, or in requesting information from the ToL Project.
The ToL Project is not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites, services or organizations to which a ToL webpage or service may link or refer.
Sharing of Information
The ToL Project only uses the personal information that you provide in order to record and support your activities within the ToL website and web-based services and to provide you information about the ToL and related activities. Personal information about ToL contributors and visitors may be shared only with ToL contractors, auditors, consultants, and collaborators. The ToL informs recipients of information about safeguarding personal information and requires them to use it only for an authorized purpose consistent with this privacy policy, and to return it or destroy it upon completion of the activity.
The ToL will disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal processes served to you, the ToL, or the site.
General Use of the ToL Website and Services
The ToL website and related search and discovery systems maintain raw log files of documents retrieved and search queries entered. Information extracted from these log files (e.g. the pages requested, referral URLs, estimation of time spent on a page, estimation of a user session, result sets from search queries) is processed in aggregate to help the ToL gauge the effectiveness of its website and services, improve the performance and structure of its website and services, and for generating general use statistics. The ToL may share this type of information with its collaborators, sponsors, consultants, and contractors to evaluate and improve the site.
Persistent Identifiers
In order to use some ToL services, a user may be required to have a persistent identifier (e.g. a login identifier.) These identifiers may link to personally identifiable information the user supplies as part of registering or signing up for a service. These identifiers will not be linked to general use information except where the user has explicitly agreed to this action when signing up for the service (and where it may be a requirement to use the service) or when a user has volunteered to participate in an evaluation study of ToL use.
IP Numbers and Domain Names
IP numbers and domain names are included in the raw log files and are used in helping to compute aggregate statistics (e.g. as a basis for defining a use session.) These IP numbers are not used to link the ToL use to any other personally identifiable information that the ToL may hold.
Cookies
The ToL website or service may use cookies to improve a visitor's interaction with the site or service. The ToL does not use cookies to track visitors except in conjunction with a service that requires keeping track of a user's sessions, or actions, for example, a service allowing a user to keep certain features (such as the on-page glossary, navigation menus, etc.) turned on or off while moving from page to page on the ToL website.
ToL Discussion Forums and Email Lists
The ToL will host and maintain a number of public email lists and forums for use by interested individuals. Some will be open for subscription and use; others will be moderated, i. e., a list or forum moderator may limit subscription and posting access. In each case, users can subscribe and unsubscribe from these areas at any time.
Please note that any information that you post to a public bulletin board is available to all visitors accessing that site. Unsubscribing from a list or forum will not remove any name, email address or information that was part of any previous posting from any archive of these lists or forums. In cases where this information came from information submitted in any registration process, the information in the public forum will not be removed when the registration is terminated and the registration information removed.
Personal Information About ToL Content Contributors
ToL content contributors must register before being able to upload materials to the ToL database. Upon registration, contributors are asked to provide personal identifying information. The type of information requested depends upon the nature of a person's contribution. Currently, the ToL distinguishes four contributor categories:

Guidelines for Children
Note: We are working on special privacy and parental involvement tools that will allow us to work with young treehouse builders under 18 years of age, but we need a little more time to get this system up and running. The following procedures will be implemented as soon as the new tools are made available on the ToL site.
Children and teenagers are advised to consult with their parents before registering for any service or giving any personal information online. Children and teenagers under 18 are eligible to register as Young ToL Treehouse Builders. The Tree of Life Project collects and stores the names and e-mail addresses of all Young Treehouse Builders. These data are maintained for the sole purpose of protecting the security and liability of the site or responding to law enforcement, if necessary.
In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the Tree of Life Project maintains the confidentiality, security and integrity of personal information collected from children. A child's personal information will be published on the ToL site only after a parent has submitted a Parental Consent Form (coming soon!). Parents are provided access to their child’s personal information and can delete the child’s personal information and opt-out of future collection or use of the information.

Required Information  First Name and Surname |
The Tree of Life Project will not generally publish the names of young treehouse builders (for exceptions see below).
---|---
Pseudonym |
Since the Tree of Life Project does not generally publish the names of young treehouse builders, children should choose a pseudonym (e.g., a variation on their first name or another made-up name), which is then used in place of their full name on their personal profile page (coming soon!) , in copyright notices, and in other credit lines for contributed text, images and other media.
Children who would like to have their contributions credited to their full name must ask their parents to submit a Parental Consent Form (coming soon!) to the Tree of Life Project detailing what information about the child can be collected and published by the Tree of Life Project.
