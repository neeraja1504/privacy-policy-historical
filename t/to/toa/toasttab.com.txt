Automatically Collected Information

Cookies
A cookie is a small, unique piece of information placed and saved in your browser when you access our websites or Merchants’ websites, services, content or ads. Cookies help us collect information about your use of the Services over time. Most web and mobile device browsers are set to automatically accept cookies by default. However, you can change your browser settings to prevent automatic acceptance of cookies, or to notify you each time a cookie is set.
You also can learn more about cookies by visiting http://www.allaboutcookies.org, which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies on different types of browsers and mobile devices.

Please note, however, that by blocking or deleting cookies used in the Services, you may not be able to use, or take full advantage of, the Services.
We use cookies to provide our Services and help collect data.

We use the information we get from the analytics tools to provide and improve our Services. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics is governed by the Google Analytics Terms of Use (available at https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the Google Partner Privacy Policy (available at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).
