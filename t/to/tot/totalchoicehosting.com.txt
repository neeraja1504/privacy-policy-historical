Privacy:
We collect a very small amount of data necessary to provide you with the best service possible.

Anything collected will never be sold to any third parties. This does not apply to affiliates that provide services to you based on links provided within your cPanel access and control, wherein information will be shared to facilitate your use of additional amenities included with the hosting services we provide. We oblige by all state and federal laws as well as the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and your privacy is a top priority of ours.
Use of Data:
Some of our services require the use of your billing information for support purposes. Because we take your privacy and protection very seriously, we may ask for various forms of identity verification during the support process. All bank and credit card information is processed only for billing purposes for any product or service you signed up for with TotalChoice Hosting. We strive to keep all information safe and use secure browsing when possible. Users of our products and services are subject to receiving e-mails from us, such as maintenance notices and our monthly newsletter but may opt-out at any time.
We use IP addresses to analyze and administer our site and servers, track access and provide security to our server farm. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. It is possible that personal information about a customer may be included in the log files due to the normal functions of IP addresses and Web browsing.
Opt Out:
By default, users of all of our services are subscribed to our maintenance updates and newsletter. Members of our forum and users of the blog may also receive e-mails from TotalChoice Hosting or its authorized contractors. You may opt out at any time via the appropriate links provided in the e-mails.
