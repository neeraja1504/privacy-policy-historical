Automatically Collected Information.
When you access or use our websites we automatically collect and store the following types of non- personally identifiable information (information that is compiled in anonymous and aggregate form and is not used to locate, contact, or identify you specifically), where available, in additional to the Personal Information you provide voluntarily: information from server logs found on your browser, click-through statistics, your IP address, the type of application (e.g. web browser) you are using to access our websites, the type of operating system you are using, the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, the date and time you access parts of the websites, and the Internet address of the site from which you linked directly to our websites. We use Google Analytics to learn about where our visitors come from and how they interact with the Website.

We may aggregate and use certain non-personally identifiable information for research or marketing purposes and may share, sell and rent or trade that information and statistical data derived from such information with our marketing partners, advertisers, or other third parties for research or marketing purposes.
4. User Communities on our Websites.
As stated above, we collect information about you through your interactions with us. Our websites include community areas (e.g., forums, bulletin boards and chat rooms) in which you may participate after establishing an associated account. Although your participation in these communities is governed by this privacy policy, there are certain important characteristics of these communities that you should always keep in mind.
We use registration information and other information users provide as they interact within the communities to: authenticate users; provide communications from us to users regarding the community; and administer the community (including, but not limited to, managing the technical requirements of the site and monitoring submissions and posts for offensive content after posting and removing such content in our sole discretion).
Please note that information (including your name, email address, address, or phone number) you provide in a posting on community or any bulletin board is available (even after you stop participating in the community) to any other individual who has access to that same community and may be used by another individual in a manner unintended by you, including as a target for unsolicited communications. You should therefore treat any information provided by you in the content of a submission or post to a community as public information. For this reason, we urge you to act cautiously in providing any such information in your submissions or posts, as we are not liable for any use or misuse by an individual user of the information you provide in a submission or post.
Upon termination of a community, Personal Information we collected through the community will continue to be treated in accordance with this privacy policy.
