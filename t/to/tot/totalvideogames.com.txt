Privacy Policy // TotalVideoGames.com
The Website
The website is provided "as is" and no guarantee or warranty is provided to the site visitors regarding the condition, completeness or uptime of the website.
Privacy
TotalVideoGames.com are 100% committed to respecting your personal privacy and protecting information about yourself.
The following notes explain how we collect, process, protect and pass on website visitor information and any personal information.
In summary
The majority of information collected is non-identifiable information, which we use to assess the success of an online branding campaign. Where any personal identifiable information is collected, every effort is made to ensure the security of this data. We do not pass this information on to companies other than TotalVideoGames.com. Also, where personal identifiable information is collected the opportunity to decline from further correspondence is always presented.
What data do we collect and how do we use it?
We collect non-personal information on general website usage; how people arrive at and navigate the web site, and how visitors use the pages, downloads and entertainment that are offered. This information provides essential feedback to the clients and potential clients, showing the effectiveness of their online branding and marketing. This information is not directly correlated against individuals.
We also collect personal identifiable information, namely email addresses for future marketing by that particular client. We may also ask about your personal interests and demographical information such as age and gender, this enables the client to see that their campaign is attracting the 'right' market. In some cases this information may be used to tailor services to you ensuring that you only get information about products and services that you may be interested in.
In some cases we collect live information based on responses to the website, which feeds back into the website viewing experience enhancing the way information is presented, this information is not retained after a particular browsing session.
Consent and opt in/out
We only ever carry out email campaigns to consented individuals. In some cases these lists are acquired from the client themselves, in this circumstance we test a sample of this list to ensure its integrity before continuing with the full campaign.
In a TotalVideoGames.com organised competition the entrant is given the chance to enter the competition without receiving any further information from TotalVideoGames.com and its' associated websites, we believe the ability to opt-out is a basic internet right.
Each individual email sent out gives recipients the chance to easily opt out of future marketing and be removed from that particular list.
Data Security
TotalVideoGames.com adhere to industry standard data security measures regarding any personal identifiable information. We have a set of security policies to ensure the integrity of the data, and we also limit access to that information. Our web servers also employ high degree of security, though in the event of any malicious and forceful attack we offer no implied warranty to the integrity of your information, rest assured that we monitor our server security regularly to prevent such a breach.
Use of Cookies
Cookies are small text files stored on your local computer to make web pages work better, they are only accessible by that particular website and not available to other websites.
We mainly use cookies to track visitor sessions, this enables us to see exactly how many people visit a website rather than just count the number of web pages, essential for our marketing figures.
We may also use cookies to save a website visitor having to repeat login to a website, to track a score in a game or save a users website preferences.
Who do we share it with?
Firstly, we only pass on personal identification information that has been consented to be passed on, and only pass it on to parties that the identifiable individual has consented to. These parties are made clear on the sign-up or competition page, where an option to not opt-in is available. We may also pass this information on to TotalVideoGames.com related projects and websites.
We do not sell or rent your email address to other parties.
In some cases we may share non-personal, or summary information regarding our users with companies who provide some portion of the products or services we offer as a whole to our clients. This information does not identify you individually, and is used as a validation of our services to partner businesses and clients.
