1. What information do we collect from you?
In order to better provide you with our numerous services, we collect two types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our sites.
Personally, Identifiable Information: This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on these sites, such as registering as a member, ordering a product or service, submitting content and/or posting content, entering a contest or sweepstakes, filling out a survey, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, we may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), e-mail address, employer, job title and department, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other personal identifying information. When ordering products or services on the sites, you may be asked to provide a credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our sites in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Web site’s Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) that you just came from, which URL you go to next, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. An URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet.
2. Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?
We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us when you:
(a) register as a member of any of our sites and/or register your e-mail address with us;
(b) enter sweepstakes or contests sponsored by us or one of our partners;
(c) sign up for special offers from selected third parties
(d) send e-mail messages, submit forms or transmit other information by telephone or letter;
(e) track your listings or progress; or
(f) submit your credit card or other payment information when ordering and purchasing products and services on our sites.
We may also collect information from you at other points on our sites that state that such information is being collected.
In addition, we may also collect, or our third-party ad server and/or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information. This information is ultimately stored in the form of store categories, and, in some cases, specific URLs. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our sites and to gather demographic information. Our third-party ad servers will also provide us with summary, but not individual, reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon at our sites.
We will primarily use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide our services to you, as required by our agreements with you. We will also use Personally Identifiable Information to enhance the operation of our sites, fill orders, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, directly market to you, statistically analyze sites use, improve our product and service offerings, and customize our sites’ content, layout, and services. We may use Personally Identifiable Information to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our agreements with you, including our Sites Terms of Use, Sales Terms and Conditions, and this Private Policy.

3. With whom do we share your information?
We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to others outside of the network.

We and our service partners use your Personally Identifiable Information to operate our sites and to deliver their services. For example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and services purchased on these sites; release your address information to the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered; and provide order information to third-parties that help us provide customer service.
We will encourage our service partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by our service partners is governed by the privacy policies of those service partners and is not subject to our control.
Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who is violating our Terms of Service or may be causing injury to or interference with other of the sites’ users or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.
We may also provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers’ sales, traffic patterns, and related sites information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information.

Your credit card information is stored with each order in our system just long enough to fully process your transaction. After the transaction has completed, your credit card information is removed from our system for security reasons. You may decline to provide credit card information and any other information at our site at any time.
