Uses and disclosures not in TOM FORD's control
Third party links
. We and other users of the website may provide links to unrelated third-party websites as well as links to websites owned and operated by entities with which we have contractual relationships. Such third party services accessible via our website (through hyperlinks or otherwise) have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please consult each site's terms & conditions and privacy policy prior to use. When you click on a hyperlink, a new browser window or frame containing a third party’s web site may appear in the foreground with the site remaining in the background. Any time that you move away from the TOM FORD website, including to a new window or frame, neither this Privacy Policy nor our other terms, such as our terms of use, will apply. TOM FORD cannot be and is not responsible for the protection of the information you provide to other websites. You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information on other websites, such information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited communications.
Advertisements on other sites.
Advertisements for our products and services may appear on third party websites around the Internet. Some websites and services deliver these advertisements based upon data that has been previously collected about your past behavior online. For example, if you have viewed websites about shoes, these websites or services may display to you an advertisement for our shoes. This kind of targeted advertising is sometimes called interest-based or online behavioral advertising. It is generally not based upon your personal information, but rather, upon your online activities. We do not control such third party websites or services on which these advertisements appear. Further, we do not control how they collect and use data about your online activities. However, you may opt-out of being tracked online by certain companies by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. If you opt-out, you will still receive advertisements, but they will not be delivered to you based upon your behavioral data possessed by the companies from whom you have opted-out. This process relies upon an opt-out cookie, so if you delete your cookies or use a different computer, you will have to repeat this process.
