California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy. As discussed above, if you want to opt-out of any sharing of your information please contact us at:

Our policy allowing customers to opt-out of information sharing with third parties for marketing purposes also applies to our Canadian customers. In addition, when we collect or otherwise acquire personal information about Canadian customers from third parties, we enter into a contract with the third party which requires them to ensure, and provide assurances to us, that they obtained informed express consent to disclose your personal information to us. If you want to know if we have obtained any information from a third party, or have any questions or concerns about the collection, use, disclosure, or correction of your personal information please contact us as set out below.
We do not share any personal information about our Canadian customers for marketing purposes such as shopping history or account information. We do provide your postal address as a Tommy Bahama customer with marketing partners to use for direct mail marketing purposes. If you would like to opt-out of the provision of your information for this purpose, please contact us at:
