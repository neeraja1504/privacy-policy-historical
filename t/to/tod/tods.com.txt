Del. U.S.A., Inc.’s CFO at the following address: r.spata@todsgroup.com. We agree to review and negotiate your claim in good faith. If we reject your claim or if we are unable to negotiate a resolution of your claim with you, then either you or we may start arbitration proceedings as provided herein (rather than in any judicial forum or court).

The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator in the city of New York, New York, U.S.A., in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). No claims of any other parties may be joined or otherwise combined in the arbitration proceeding. Unless otherwise expressly required by applicable law, each party shall bear its own attorneys fees without regard to which party is deemed the prevailing party in the arbitration proceeding.

The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. We each agree that any proceedings, whether in arbitration or court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class or representative action or as a member in a class, consolidated or representative action. If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that this class action waiver is unenforceable, the above arbitration agreement will be void as to you. An. Del.
