Use of Scalable Central Measuring procedure
The Universal Music website uses the “Scalable Central Measuring method” (SZM) by the company INFOline for the determination of statistical parameters of the use of our site. Thereby anonymous measured data is collected. SZM-range measurement uses -for the recognition of computer systems- alternatively either a cookie with the ID ivwbox.de or a signature that is created from various automatically transmitted information of your computer. IP addresses are not stored in the procedure and are only processed in anonymous form.
The range measurement has been aligned with data protection. The aim of the range measurement is to determine the intensity of use and the number of users of a site randomly. At no time will individual users be identified. Your identity is always protected.
For websites that are members of the information community to determine the distribution of advertising (Informationsgemeinschaft zur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbeträgern e.V. [IVW]) or take part in the study “internet facts” of the association of online-research (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Online-Forschung e.V. [AGOF]) the usage statistics will be published on a monthly basis by AGOF, the “Arbeitsgemeinschaft Media-Analyse e.V.” and the IVW and can be viewed at the above mentioned websites.
In addition to the publication of measured data, the IVW checks the SZM procedure regularly with regard to a rule-and privacy-compliant use. More information about SZM procedure can be found on the website of the INFOnline GmbH, which operates the SZM procedure, the data protection website of AGOF and the data protection website of the IVW.
