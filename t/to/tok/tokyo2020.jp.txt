In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal information under certain conditions.
These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person, where it would infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights) or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping.
