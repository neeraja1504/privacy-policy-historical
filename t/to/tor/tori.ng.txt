Facebook App
This privacy policy applies to content provided by us and your use of the Tori.ng Facebook App (the 'Tori.ng').
As a registered Facebook user, you are also subject to Facebook's privacy policy. Please check your Facebook account privacy settings for further information.
Collecting Information About You
We collect different types of information about App users for four main reasons:
1. To personalise the content of the App for individual users.
2. To help us to monitor and improve the App.
3. To advertise on the App.
4. With user consent, to market services to individual users.
Sharing your information with us and others
When you first access the App, for example by clicking on a link to a Tori.ng from your Facebook newsfeed, you will be presented with a Facebook permissions page, which will advise you about the Facebook information you will be sharing with the App and other Facebook users. You can then decide whether or not to share your Facebook information by using the App. If you decide not to grant permission you will not be able to use the App.
By granting permission you will be agreeing to share your Facebook user details (including your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user ID and any other information you choose to share according to your Facebook account settings) as well as the user details of your Facebook friends, and information about your use of the App, for example, the articles you are reading.
If you choose to post content or other data on the App, for example, by commenting on an article, this can be accessed by all of your Facebook friends.
If you decide not to share information with your Facebook friends about a particular article you have accessed you can make your reading private using the 'remove from timeline' facility at the top of the article page.
Unsubscribing
To unsubscribe go to 'Why am I seeing this version of the page?' at the top of the article page and select 'Remove this application'. Alternatively, remove the App by accessing the application settings in your Facebook account settings.
Once you remove the App we no longer have permission to access your Facebook information and your data will be removed from the App.
