3. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES & COOKIES
TORYCOMICS and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers, may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.

However, if you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use some features or areas of our websites may be limited.
