2. Identifying Purposes
Toronto Hydro will identify the purposes for which it collects personal information at or before the time the information is collected, such as when you apply for service from us (for example, purposes may be identified on Toronto Hydro forms or by reference to this Privacy Policy Statement). Toronto Hydro collects, uses and discloses personal information as authorized or required by applicable law (including MFIPPA) and for purposes such as:
To authenticate identity;
To contact customers (at mailing and/or service address), respond to customer inquiries or service issues, and to otherwise maintain business relations with customers;
To deliver, monitor and maintain electricity service;

To provide information to credit bureaus and other utility providers to update credit information;
To address and respond to issues related to the usage of critical, power dependant, medical equipment during an outage;

To provide individuals with information they have requested, such as financial quarterly reports or news releases;
To prepare financial records for Toronto Hydro; and
To meet other legal, regulatory and electricity market operation authorizations and requirements.
The above collections, uses and disclosures, which are not exhaustive, are a necessary part of your relationship with Toronto Hydro.
3. Consent
Toronto Hydro will obtain your consent before, or when, it collects, uses or discloses your personal information, except where collection, use or disclosure is authorized or required by law. For example, by accepting distribution and related services from us, your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information for the purposes of providing you with such distribution and related services is implied.
Consent may be provided orally, in writing, electronically, or implied (such as when you fail to notify Toronto Hydro that you do not consent to collection/use/disclosure for certain purposes after you have received notice of those purposes, for example, through this Privacy Policy Statement) or otherwise.
Consent may be obtained directly from you or from a third party that has obtained your consent to disclose your personal information to Toronto Hydro. For example, if you sign a separate contract with a retailer, Toronto Hydro may obtain your personal information from the retailer and Toronto Hydro may provide your billing and consumption information to the retailer. Consent may also be given by an authorized representative such as a legal guardian or person with power of attorney.
Subject to certain legal and contractual restrictions and reasonable notice, you can refuse or withdraw your consent to the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information at any time. However, refusal to provide such consent, or withdrawal of such consent, may prevent us from providing you with certain products or services for which information is necessary.
In certain circumstances under the laws of Canada and Ontario, Toronto Hydro may have a duty or right to collect, use or disclose your personal information without your knowledge or consent.
4. Limiting Collection and Access
Toronto Hydro will not collect personal information indiscriminately and will limit collection of personal information to that which is reasonable and necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy Statement or as otherwise consented to by you, and as authorized or required by applicable law.
Likewise, access to personal information will be restricted to only those Employees of Toronto Hydro who require access in order to perform their duties in fulfilling the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy Statement, and as authorized or required by applicable law.
Section 34 of MFIPPA requires Toronto Hydro to keep an updated Personal Information Bank, which is defined as “a collection of personal information that is organized and capable of being retrieved using an individual’s name or an identifying number or particular assigned to the individual.” You can contact Toronto Hydro to obtain a copy of the Personal Information Bank at privacy@torontohydro.com.
5. Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention
Toronto Hydro will use and disclose personal information as reasonable and necessary for the purposes outlined above as otherwise consented to by you, and as authorized or required by applicable law. For example, MFIPPA lists general categories of circumstances where the use and disclosure of personal information is permitted by law under sections 31 and 32 of that statute.
Further, because of the structure of the electricity sector in Ontario, it may be necessary to share your billing and consumption information with third party billing and settlement agencies, such as where you have signed a separate contract with a retailer. Our billing, settlement and regulatory relationships with third parties are governed by our license and regulatory codes that are established by the Ontario Energy Board. In accordance with the Affiliates Relationship Code, Toronto Hydro will not disclose any consumer information (which may include personal information) to any of its affiliates without the consumer's written consent except where consumer information is required to be disclosed:
for billing or market operation purposes;
for law enforcement purposes; or
for the purpose of complying with a legal requirement.
Toronto Hydro will retain personal information only for so long as is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and to meet our legal and contractual obligations. Toronto Hydro will not trade, rent or sell your personal information. However, in the course of a business transaction, such as a proposed sale of Toronto Hydro's business or assets (or a part thereof), or a merger or amalgamation of Toronto Hydro with another company, we may disclose (with appropriate safeguards) your personal information to third parties such as prospective purchasers of Toronto Hydro's shares, business or assets, and to their lawyers, accountants, financial advisors, agents and other representatives as necessary for the purposes of such transaction.
6. Accuracy
Toronto Hydro maintains procedures to ensure that the personal information we collect, use and disclose is kept as accurate, complete and up-to-date as necessary for the purpose for which it is to be used. However, we rely on you to disclose all material information to us and to inform us of any errors or changes in such information.
Individuals may challenge the accuracy and completeness of personal information about them and have it amended or annotated, as appropriate, as set out in Section 9 below.
7. Safeguards
In fulfilling its responsibilities with respect to the confidentiality of personal information, Toronto Hydro will employ a number of safeguards, appropriate to the sensitivity of the specific information, to protect personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. Such safeguards will include physical measures, organizational measures and technological measures, such as locked filing cabinets, restricted access to offices, security clearances, limiting access on a "need to know" basis, use of passwords and encryption. Procedures for implementing these measures will be communicated to all employees and relevant third parties to ensure compliance. It is also important for you to take precautions to protect your personal information such as keeping your user name and passwords confidential.
8. Openness
This Privacy Policy Statement is effective as of the Effective Date set forth at the beginning of this Privacy Policy Statement. Toronto Hydro will review this Privacy Policy Statement annually and may make revisions to this Privacy Policy Statement from time to time. Toronto Hydro will endeavour to bring such revisions to the attention of its customers and members of the public by such means as Toronto Hydro's Website and bill inserts.
9. Individual Access
Upon request and with satisfactory proof of the customer's identity, any customer of Toronto Hydro may obtain information regarding the type, use and disclosure, of his, or her, personal information that Toronto Hydro has in its custody or control. Any customer may request that his, or her, personal information be amended for purposes of accuracy and completeness. Where a disagreement regarding the accuracy of a customer’s information cannot be resolved, Toronto Hydro will annotate the information to reflect the disagreement. Toronto Hydro may require the customer to provide access or correction requests in writing. We may also charge a nominal fee for responding to such requests, and, if so, will advise you in advance of such costs. This right of access, however, is not absolute. For instance, Toronto Hydro may refuse to provide you with access to your personal information where such refusal is authorized or required by law or regulatory authorities.
Customers can make their requests by contacting Toronto Hydro by telephone at 416-542-8000, by fax to 416-542-452, or in writing to Toronto Hydro, Customer Care, 500 Commissioners Street, Toronto, Ontario M4M 3N7, and our customer service representatives will assist you. Response to a customer's request will be made within a reasonable time provided the request is made in writing and the customer provides satisfactory proof of the customer's identity.
10. Challenging Compliance
Any customer of Toronto Hydro may challenge Toronto Hydro's compliance with this Privacy Policy Statement in respect of his or her personal information by contacting Toronto Hydro's Chief Privacy Officer, in writing, at the address set forth in Section 1.
The Chief Privacy Officer will be responsible for investigating all allegations of non-compliance with this Privacy Policy Statement. To the extent possible, the investigation will be conducted in a timely manner. After the investigation is completed, the customer will be advised of the outcome, and a resolution will be implemented, if necessary, as soon as practicable. If it is determined that a breach of this Privacy Policy Statement has occurred, appropriate corrective action will be taken. Confidentiality will be maintained throughout the investigation to the extent possible and consistent with the goal of a full and fair investigation.
If the Chief Privacy Officer does not resolve the issue to the customer's satisfaction, the customer may contact the Privacy Commissioner of Ontario.
