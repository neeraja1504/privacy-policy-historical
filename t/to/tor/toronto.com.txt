This Privacy Policy governs the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in any form, whether written, electronic or otherwise, by the Star. Be aware that our websites, digital properties, mobile applications and mobile enabled sites (our “Sites”) may contain links to other websites that are maintained by third parties who are not required to comply with this Privacy Policy and for which the Star has no responsibility. Please review the privacy policies on any third party websites to determine their information handling practices.
This Privacy Policy is available to the public through our Sites, and in paper form from the Star. If you have any additional concerns or questions, we encourage you to contact us and we will address your concerns to the best of our ability.

What is personal information?
Personal information is any information about an identifiable individual. The Star is responsible for personal information in its possession and under its control. The Star has implemented policies and practices to give effect to this Privacy Policy, including training and communicating with our employees about the importance of privacy and implementing security procedures that reasonably protect the personal information you provide to us. In addition, Torstar Corporation, the Star’s parent company, has appointed a Chief Privacy Officer to oversee personal information-handling practices of the Star.

If you enter a contest or other promotion, we collect and use your personal contact information to administer the contest or promotion including contacting, announcing and promoting prizewinners, and responding to your inquiries. In addition, sometimes our contest rules provide that we may contact contest entrants with promotions and product information. Those rules will also include a way for you to indicate to us that you do not want to be contacted for this purpose. Some contests may also involve co-sponsors, who have their own privacy practices. In these cases, the contest rules and/or entry forms will indicate that your personal information is also being collected by these co-sponsors and will provide you with the ability to opt-out from receiving promotions and product information from them.
