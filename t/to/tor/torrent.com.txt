Our privacy practices are designed to seek to provide protection for your personal information, all over the world. We may share your information within Ascential and transfer it to members of the Ascential global organization and our partners in other countries in the world where we do business. Although some countries may provide less legal protection for you information, in such countries Ascential will still handle your information in the manner described here. We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its quality. We therefore implement appropriate measures and processes to help us to keep your information secure and to maintain its quality.
Mergers and Acquisitions
Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Ascential decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganise businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personally identifiable information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from prospective or actual sellers. It is Ascential's practice to take reasonable steps to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions. You should be aware, however, that Ascential takes no responsibility for actions taken, or any inactions, by any prospective or actual purchasers or sellers who receive such information.
Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. After a user closes his or her browser, cookies may stay active for a period of 14 days so users do not have to reenter registration information. If a user rejects the cookie, he or she may still use our site. The principal drawback to rejecting a cookie is that the user will have only limited access to certain areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Sharing
We will not share aggregated demographic information that may contain personally identifiable information with our partners. However, we do partner with third parties who provide specific systems integration or data management services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share personally identifiable information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.
