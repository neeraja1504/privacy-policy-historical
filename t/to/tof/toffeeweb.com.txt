ToffeeWeb - About - Privacy Policy
What we collect from you
Unless you’re a registered member of ToffeeWeb, the only information that is captured or read by our servers when you browse the site is anonymous data like your IP address, web browser, screen size and resolution, etc, stored in your browser in the form of cookies — small, harmless text files that reside on your device.
We use some of that information for analytics or to tailor the layout to your device but is not stored in any way by us. (More on cookies below).
From registered members , we capture, with your consent, the bare minimum of personal information in order to create a unique user account, including your name, email address and chosen password. Beyond that, members may furnish us with more data on an optional basis in the form of preferences — display and font choices, etc — or further contact details for the purposes of contests.
When you created your account, you were given the option of opting in or out of any email updates from ToffeeWeb and you can change that preference via the Edit Profile link at the top of the page at any time.
From ToffeeWeb Patron sponsors we use the same baseline data as above as well as your payment details to establish your subscription but none of your credit card/billing information is stored on our servers. The transactions are handled by Braintree Payments, a PayPal company. All of this information is also done with your consent when you sign up.
You are free to remove this information from ToffeeWeb’s databases by deleting your account at any time.
We don’t share your information
None of the data you share with ToffeeWeb directly is distributed or sold to any third parties without your permission unless in the highly unlikely event we are required to do so for legal reasons. It is only visible to the site owners and moderators and used for the purposes of running the membership portion of the website or capturing users’ contact details for the purposes of holding competitions for prizes, etc.
Third-party advertising
Some of the web advertising companies used by our site to deliver ads may track your Internet usage and browsing habits and may tailor ads displayed on ToffeeWeb based on information they have collected from you.
We at ToffeeWeb have no bearing on what adverts are displayed by these third-party ad carriers (e.g. Google Adsense, Stanza), nor do we have any access to any tracking information they may store or collect.
By using ToffeeWeb, you acknowledge that your presence on the website may be logged by these third parties, just as with any other website carrying ads by the same company.
More on the use of Cookies
In short: They're harmless and very useful
We use cookies on the website to store user preferences and, in particular, to retain session information of registered Members. In order to remain logged into your ToffeeWeb account over time or for the site to remember your browsing preferences (e.g. font size, mobile version, etc) cookies must be enabled in your browser.
What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are stored in your browser and are the beacons by which the website recognises you when you return. They are harmless and the cookies we use do not collect any information about you other than your chosen username and the browsing preferences you select to enhance your experience on ToffeeWeb.
If you choose to disable cookies within your browser, just remember that certain functionality or pages on the website might not operate correctly and that ToffeeWeb will be unable to retain your login information for subsequent visits to the website.
Additionally, third-party advertisers may use cookies to collect anonymous information while you browse the website and use the information gleaned from your visits to other sites to display related advertising on ToffeeWeb. This information allows ad networks, including Google Adsense's DART cookies, to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy at http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html
By using the website, you are consenting to ToffeeWeb using cookies in the manner described here and in accordance with the privacy policies above. You can disable them but it will affect the way the website works for you.
