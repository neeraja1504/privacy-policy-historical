New Zealand Tourism Guide (NZTG) Website Privacy and Security Policy.
New Zealand Tourism Guide (NZTG) is committed to the privacy and security of web site users, and this statement outlines existing practices.
Use of your information
NZTG does not sell or rent your personal identification to third parties.
If applicable we release personal information only when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our terms and conditions; or protect the rights, property, or safety of NZTG, our users or others.
Email
It is our policy to immediately remove any person from any mailing list provided you are the person who opted into any list.
We do use email as a means of receiving feedback from our customers, and we encourage you to email us with your questions or comments.
Control of Your Password
You are responsible for all actions taken with your user name and password. We recommend you do not disclose your password to any third party. If you do choose to share your user name password or your information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with this information.
Security
We work diligently to protect the security of your personal information.
We protect your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. Any time you book or buy using a credit card your details are encrypted and securely.
It is your responsibility to protect yourself against unauthorised access to your password and credit card from any third party.
NZTG takes all reasonable steps to keep any collected personal information secure and to protect that information from misuse or loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
Please note however that total security of data transmission over the internet cannot be guaranteed. NZTG therefore cannot guarantee and does not warrant the security of information transmitted over the internet.
