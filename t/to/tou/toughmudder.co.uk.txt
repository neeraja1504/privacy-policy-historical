RaceIt.com has its own privacy policy and you should refer to it for any questions you may have about the information RaceIt collects about you when you register for one of our events or to be a spectator using RaceIt.com. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. We also collect details of transactions you carry out through our site and of the fulfilment of your orders.
