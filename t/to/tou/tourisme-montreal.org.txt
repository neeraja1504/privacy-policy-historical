1. Information collected about you
On all Tourisme Montréal Web pages where identifiable personal information is collected, Tourisme Montréal specifically lists all of the information required to access any product or service you request.
Identifiable personal information is that which refers to and serves to identify an individual. Unless required by law or a court order issued by a competent tribunal, Tourisme Montréal preserves the confidentiality of all personal information obtained about users of its Web sites. Tourisme Montréal does not sell or lease your identifiable personal information to anyone.
Personal information is collected by Tourisme Montréal on a fully transparent, voluntary basis. Information may be collected in several different situations, all of which are listed in the table below. In each of these scenarios, users who enter personal information authorize Tourisme Montréal to collect this information. All compulsory information that is collected has been deemed necessary and reasonable in light of the services provided by Tourisme Montréal.
In surveys, when you authorize Tourisme Montréal to send you emails, your personal information (first and last names, email address, mailing address) is treated in the same way as when you sign up for a newsletter.
2. Sharing personal information
To provide the services you request and process your requests, Tourisme Montréal shares your personal information with authorized suppliers or service providers that are called upon to provide some services or perform certain tasks on behalf of Tourisme Montréal.  Although Tourisme Montréal publishes offers from travel suppliers or service providers that are reputable companies, it has not imposed any restrictions on these suppliers or service providers regarding the use or disclosure of your information without your consent. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy and confidentiality practices of any supplier or service provider whose products you book via Tourisme Montréal. In addition, these suppliers or service providers may also contact you as necessary to obtain additional information.
Tourisme Montréal does not disclose any personal information relative to a user unless it is used exclusively to answer a specific user request or is intended for explicitly authorized purposes. Furthermore, the confidentiality of electronically transmitted information is ensured by use of stringent security measures.

3. Security measures
We want our members and visitors to feel confident about using the Tourisme Montréal Web sites to plan and book travel services. As a result, we are committed to protecting the information we collect. Tourisme Montréal has implemented a security program to protect the information stored in its systems from unauthorized access. Currently, Tourisme Montréal can only store the information you provide when you register to become a Tourisme Montréal member or create a user profile.
Our systems are configured to encrypt and scramble data, and are protected by industry-standard technologies and firewalls. When you transmit personal information to Tourisme Montréal over the Internet, your data is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to ensure safe transmission.
Notwithstanding the security measures deployed by Tourisme Montréal to ensure that third parties are unable to obtain your personal information via its Web site, complete confidentiality and security on the Internet cannot be guaranteed by anyone at this time. Communications via the Internet are subject to interception, loss or alteration. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NEITHER TOURISME MONTRÉAL NOR ITS GROUP MEMBERS CAN BE HELD LIABLE FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OR PERSONAL INFORMATION OVER THE INTERNET, AND THAT SUCH COMMUNICATIONS ARE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
The means of protecting your personal information used by Tourisme Montréal also apply to the internal use of your information.
All of your personal information is kept on our secure servers located in Canada and the United States, and only authorized personnel from Tourisme Montréal and its suppliers have access to it. In addition, the servers used to store your personal information are kept on a secure site.
The means of protecting your personal information also extend to our Web services suppliers. When personal information is handled, data governance shall include procedures for handling and converting data to ensure that users’ personal information is protected. These operations shall be specific to each environment.
Tourisme Montréal only keeps your personal information as long as necessary for a specific purpose or as required by law. Tourisme Montréal has implemented deletion measures for personal information that is obsolete or no longer necessary.
These measures are specified in the table appearing in Section 1 of this document.
4. Use of cookies
Some Tourisme Montréal sites store cookies, permanent or otherwise, on the user’s hard drive. These cookies help facilitate browsing by entering the user’s language preference. Other permanent cookies make it possible, among other things, to know how often a user navigates one of the sites during a predetermined time period.
Finally, some cookies are used to collect general, non-identifying information. Mainly, these cookies help determine what types of advertisements match the user. The cookie is associated with a unique number identifying the computer (IP address). The IP address shall be used to recommend content to you according to your geolocation only. It cannot be combined with other information collected about you. The cookie does not contain the user’s name, address, telephone number, email address or other identifying information. Our cookie only collects general, non-identifying information such as the computer operating system, browser, visited webpages and time of use, the Internet provider’s geographic location and anonymous demographic information, such as gender or age category, collected via anonymous online surveys. Cookies are also sent from the servers of our authorized suppliers and service providers. We use their services to determine and analyze how you use our Web platforms so that we can improve their quality. Only general, non-identifying information is collected for this purpose. In addition, our authorized suppliers and service providers comply with recognized principles for protecting personal information and must also respect their own privacy policies.
Tourisme Montréal uses social media to enhance its Web presence. Users who choose to communicate with Tourisme Montréal via social media must read the terms of service and privacy policies of these third-party service providers and the applications used to access them.
Cookies must be enabled in your browser in order for some of Tourisme Montréal’s sites to work properly. However, users may then delete cookies from their computer or mobile device without it affecting how Tourisme Montréal sites work on their computer. Alternatively, users can also deactivate advertiser cookies.
Deactivating advertiser cookies
Tourisme Montréal allows users to deactivate the cookie associated with advertisements, which prevents the use of specific information about the user’s browsing history or behaviour for targeted advertising purposes. Deactivating this cookie does not prevent ads from being sent to a computer, but it does prevent data from being associated with the computer browser and thereby prevents targeted advertising.
Please note that the cookie deactivation mechanism used by Tourisme Montréal requires that your browser accept third-party cookies from Tourisme Montréal.
If you wish to deactivate behavioural targeting from Tourisme Montréal, please click here. To reactivate behavioural targeting so that you can receive ads that match your browsing history, please delete the cookies from your browser.
Please note that all other cookies associated with your browser will not be affected. Tourisme Montréal ads will be deactivated for the duration of your browser’s lifetime on your hard drive or until you delete the cookie from your hard drive. The cookie deactivation process will delete the cookie file but not the cookie itself. You must keep the deactivation cookie in your computer in order to be identified as a user who has deactivated the cookie. If you change your mind after deactivating the cookie, click on the aforementioned clickable link to edit your choice.
