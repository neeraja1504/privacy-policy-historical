Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
We may use cookies, web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels") and other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you interact with our websites or emails, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior. We may combine this information with other information we collect about you and use it for various purposes, such as improving our websites and your online experience, understanding which areas and features of our sites are popular, counting visits, understanding campaign effectiveness, tailoring our communications with you, determining whether an email has been opened and links within the email have been clicked and for other internal business purposes.
Cookies
Cookies are data files that are placed on a computer when it is used to visit a website. These cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, tracking user preferences or web pages visited while using our websites. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually set your browser to remove or reject cookies, but note that doing so does not necessarily affect third party flash cookies used in connection with our websites. For more information about disabling flash cookies, see Adobe Flash Player. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our websites. In addition, please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, some advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected.
Web Beacons
We may include small graphic images called web beacons, also known as "Internet tags" or "clear gifs," in our web pages and email messages. We may use web beacons or similar technologies for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to our websites, to monitor how users navigate the websites, and to count how many emails that we sent were actually opened or how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
Location-identifying Technologies
We may use GPS (global positioning systems) software and other location-based technologies such as iBeacons (as defined below) to locate you so we may verify your location, and deliver relevant content to you based on your location. In addition to traditional GPS location-based services, we may install low power Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, radio transmitters, or other devices in physical locations, which emit a signal that we can detect to pinpoint your location or otherwise facilitate your interaction with our websites and offline retail locations (“iBeacons”).
Embedded Scripts
An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service. It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from our web server or a third party with whom we work, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deleted or deactivated thereafter.
Information we automatically collect about you, such as how you interact with our websites, may be combined with your Personal Information. If we associate any such automatically-collected information with Personal Information about you, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.
We and our business partners and other third parties may send you product promotions that are aligned with your purchase trends identified through automatically-collected information.
Information We Collect From Our Partners and Other Sources
We may also obtain information about you from other sources and combine that with information we collect about you. For example, we collect information from the U.S. Postal Service's national change of address database to verify and update mailing addresses. In addition, if you apply for a Tourneau credit card, we obtain limited information about you from the partner that manages our co-brand credit card program. We may also supplement the information we collect about you with outside records from third party data cooperatives in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. If we receive Personal Information from a third party source and/or if we combine the information we receive from these third party sources with your Personal Information, we will treat that information as Personal Information. We are not responsible for the accuracy of the information provided by third parties or how such third parties collect, use and share such information.

Sharing Of Information
Our agents, vendors, consultants and other service providers, including third party delivery services, may have access to Personal Information to carry out work on our behalf. These third party service providers and agents are prohibited from using your Personal Information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance and are contractually bound to keep Personal Information confidential. For example, third parties that we use for delivery services will only use your Personal Information for the purpose of completing your delivery.
In addition, we may share information about you as follows:
With our business partners and other third parties for purposes of sending their own direct mail in partnership with Tourneau and/or with cooperative data sharing partnerships unless you opt out of this type of sharing by emailing us at customerservice@tourneau.com.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in response to i) subpoenas or other legal process or if in our good faith opinion such disclosure is required or permitted by law; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation;
To defense the Terms of Use or other policies applicable to our websites and mobile applications;
If we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of us or any third party;
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we may also use IP addresses, mobile device identifiers or any other information we collect to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies in our discretion.

We may offer sweepstakes, contests, surveys and other promotions (each, a “Promotion”) that may require registration. If you choose to enter a Promotion, your Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties in connection with the administration of such Promotion, such as in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law, such as on a winners list. By entering a Promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor and/or other parties to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials. Tourneau may offer opportunities to enter a contest or sweepstakes or other feature that we offer jointly with a third party. As a result of your participation in such feature, your information may be shared with the third party that is jointly offering the feature, which will be disclosed at the time your information is collected.
Advertising, & Analytics Services and Online Tracking
We engage third parties to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services about the use of our websites and mobile applications. In addition, we may participate in online advertising networks and exchanges that display relevant advertisements to our website and mobile application visitors based on their interests as reflected in their browsing of the websites and mobile applications and certain third party sites participating in the same networks and exchanges. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, and other technologies to automatically collect information about your use of our websites and mobile applications, such as your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our websites and other websites and better understand your online activity.
This means that some information about your browsing of our websites and mobile applications and certain third party sites may be shared with these companies for the purpose of delivering ads to you on our websites and mobile applications and certain third party sites, and Tourneau may receive from some of these companies information about third party sites that you have visited. This information is used for marketing purposes and the practice is sometimes termed "retargeting" to indicate that information from one retailer is used to suggest to you relevant products offered by another retailer.
These and other third parties may also collect Personal Information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use our websites and mobile applications.
We may also work with third parties to serve ads to you as part of a customized campaign on other websites or platforms.
This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that such third parties themselves may have collected from you (e.g., type of browser, operating system, domain name, day and time of visit, page(s) visited) or the methods used by the third-parties to collect that information (e.g., cookies, web beacons and clear gifs).
Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many websites and online services, Tourneau currently does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you may wish to visit All About Do Not Track (DNT).

Our websites may provide you the opportunity to participate and post content publicly through chat rooms, forums, interactive features, or other communication functionality (“Community Features”).

The information we collect in connection with Social Features is subject to this Privacy Policy.

California Transparency in Supply Chains Act Disclosure
Tourneau is celebrating 115 years of expertise as the preeminent purveyor of fine timepieces. It is the policy of Tourneau to provide a healthy, respectful and productive workplace for our employees. We support a respectful workplace with associates who are considerate of each other and always act with integrity and fairness. As enshrined in our Store Associate Handbook, although slavery and human trafficking are not explicitly referenced, we have zero tolerance for any form of discriminatory or harassing behavior, workplace violence, or any other type of disrespectful behavior. We uphold this policy with regards to all associates, applications, customers, vendors and business partners.
We expect our associates to always execute to the highest level of fairness, professionalism, and adherence to legal guidelines, and also to report any known or suspected violations of law, company policy or harassment to the attention of managers, human resources, or via Tourneau’s hotline. Our hotline is available to employees 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and callers have the option of identifying themselves or remaining anonymous. The hotline is monitored and operated by an outside company. We prohibit any retaliation against associates who report concerns or participate in an investigation.
All reported allegations will be investigated promptly, thoroughly, and impartially. The investigation may include individual interviews with the parties involved and, where necessary, with individuals who may have observed the alleged conduct or may have other relevant knowledge. While some offenses may result in disciplinary action, other offenses could result in immediate termination.
While we applaud the purpose and spirit of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, the majority of our watches are certified as either Swiss-made or pre-owned, which we do not believe carry a significant risk of having human trafficking or slavery present in their supply chains. Therefore, at present we do not: (1) engage in verification of product supply chains to evaluate or address risks of human trafficking and slavery; (2) conduct audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with anti-slavery and human trafficking standards; (3) require our suppliers to certify that they comply with anti-slavery and human trafficking laws in the country or countries in which they do business; (4) other than as set forth in our Store Associate Handbook, maintain internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors for failing to meet anti-slavery and human trafficking standards; or (5) provide company employees or management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management with training on anti-slavery and human trafficking laws.
