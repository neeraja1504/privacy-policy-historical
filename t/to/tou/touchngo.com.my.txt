Privacy Policy
TNGSB respects the right to privacy of our customers. Our privacy policy ensures that we protect the trust you place in us when you provide us with your personal information. Keeping customer information secure, and using it only as our customers would want us to, is a top priority for all of us at TNGSB.
TNGSB Privacy Policy
1.      We will safeguard, according to strict standards of security and confidentiality, any information our customers share with us.
2.      We will limit the collection and use of customer information to the minimum as may be required to deliver superior service to our customers, which includes advising our customers about our products, services and other opportunities, and to administer our business.
3.      We will permit only authorized employees, who are trained in the proper handling of customer information, to have access to that information.
4.      Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services, we will require them to conform to our privacy standards and to allow us to audit them for compliance.
Collection of Personal Information
The information we collect is information that we require in order to perform our services and offer our products to you. This information is similar to the information typically collected by us on the application forms, which include, but not limited to, your name and address details, date of birth, details such as telephone number and others.
You may choose to give us personal information directly in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us your name and contact information to communicate with you to register for a service, to provide you with a subscription, or to do business with us if you are a supplier or business affiliate/alliance. If you inform us that you do not want us to use your information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your request, we will respect your wishes.
From time to time, we may also collect information that pertains to you indirectly through other sources (if any). When we do so, we require the third party to confirm that the information was legally acquired by them and that we have the right to obtain it from them and use it. The information that we collect, either directly or indirectly, may be combined to help us improve its overall accuracy and completeness and to help us better tailor our interactions with you.
