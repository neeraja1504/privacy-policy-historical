Links to 3rd Party Sites:
Top10Links contains links to other web sites on the Internet. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site.
Security of User Information:
Top10Links takes every precaution to protect our usersâ€™ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.
If and when we or one of the payment processing companies we use asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.
While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just â€˜surfingâ€™. To learn more about SSL, click here.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our usersâ€™ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.
Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must reenter their password to regain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customersâ€™ information is protected.
Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information at our website, please contact us.
Supplemental Information:
In order for this website to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it may be necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.
For example, to determine if our customers qualify for credit terms, we may use their name and social security number to request a credit report. Once we determine a userâ€™s creditworthiness, this document is destroyed.
Or in order for Top10Links to enhance its ability to tailor the site to an individualâ€™s preference, we may combine information about the purchasing habits of users with similar information from our partners to create a personalized user profile. When a user makes a purchase from one of our partners, they collect and share that purchase information with us so we can tailor the site to our usersâ€™ preferences.

We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.
