TopCashback - Privacy
We hold only a minimal amount of information on each registered member.
To register as a member, we only require an email address and a password. Prior to sending any payments, we will also require relevant account details in order to give you your money.
We only hold information in order to allow users to log into and run their accounts. We will also keep accounts updated with cashback levels. Registered users may update their account details online by following the relevant links from within their account page.
Member usernames and basic related statistics may occasionally be exposed. Examples of this include where a person has followed your referral link, they may see your name; and where a member who was referred to TopCashback has a balance under the referral threshold amount (currently ₹ 300.00), that balance may be visible to the referring member. If you were referred to TopCashBack this latter fact will be made clear in your account details page, from which you may opt-out of allowing the referrer from being able to see your account balance.
Where selected (the default), account balances are only displayed until you reach the referral threshold (currently ₹ 300.00).
Once this is reached your account balance will no longer be visible.
We may examine traffic patterns in order to improve our services, to help monitor purchases and cashback and keep accounts up to date.
We do not send junk email or spam. We may send emails with site updates or offers, but users will be able to specify the type of emails they receive.
We do not pass users details on to third parties, unless specifically requested to do so by the users.
An exception to the above is that we may pass your details on to the merchants or their agents for verification of transactions only and for fraud prevention measures. Any details passed on will not be used for marketing or any other purposes.
Users may request to see any information that we hold on them. This may include purchase information, account totals, contact details and other information. Users may request this information by using our contact us form. There may be a small administration fee for using this service, which will be no more than ₹ 5.
It is possible that we will wish to use customer information in unanticipated ways, not stated in our Privacy Policy. In this event, we will contact individuals before using the data for new purposes, so that the individual users may opt-out if they wish.
We aim to be very flexible and transparent in the use of members details. If users wish for their account to be deleted or amended in any way - or if they wish to prevent us from using their information for any purposes, either as initially stated or for any new purposes - then they may contact us using our contact us form and we will endeavor to comply with their wishes.
If any user feels this site is not following its stated information policy, then they may inform us through our contact us form.
