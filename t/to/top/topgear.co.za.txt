PRIVACY AT BBC WORLDWIDE
Last updated: 15 June 2015
BBC Worldwide Limited (BBCW) is the main commercial arm and a wholly owned subsidiary of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). It is a UK based company operating in countries around the world through its subsidiaries. The information in these pages relate to the privacy practices of the companies in the BBC Worldwide group, (herein referred to as "BBCW", "we", "our" or "us").
BBCW respects your right to privacy and we take our related legal obligations seriously. We aim to be transparent at all times about our treatment of your information. You can read the full policy below for details about how your information will be used, when it may be disclosed to others and your rights in relation to the information we hold. If you find reading a policy a bit daunting or if you just want a quick snapshot of our approach then we suggest you start with  Our Promise.
WHO WE ARE
BBCW exists to support the BBC's public service mission and to maximise profits on its behalf. We do this through investing in, commercialising and showcasing BBC content around the world, in a way that is consistent with BBC standards and values.
We operate a variety of BBC-branded commercial services, such as TV channels, online shops, websites, games, mobile apps and live events. For more information please refer to our corporate website at: www.bbcworldwide.com.
OUR PROMISE
We will comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulatory frameworks.
We will only use your personal information to supply, improve and manage our services. Any additional or unusual uses of your information will be explained at the point of collection.
We will only send you marketing emails if you have permitted us to (and you will be given the opportunity to unsubscribe in each of our emails).
We will enable you to opt-out of usage tracking where possible; we track your use of our services to help us to tailor our content and advertising and to improve our services. We will not use information that identifies you personally but if you prefer, you may opt-out here.
We will not share personally identifiable information with unrelated third parties for their own use without your consent. We may share your information within our group of companies so that we can provide you with the best customer experience across our brands.
We will take appropriate steps to safeguard your information in accordance with industry standards but please keep in mind that no system can be guaranteed as 100% secure.
We will only keep your information for as long as we need it: (i) to provide you with a product/service; (ii) to improve our services; and (iii) for legal and audit purposes.
We will not actively collect personal information from under 13s and kindly ask that if you are under 13 you do not give us information about yourself or others.
We will give you control over the information we hold about you by enabling you to access, update and delete your information in-line with your legal rights.
We will take steps to ensure that our suppliers and licensees look after your information as we do, including where they are processing your information in countries that do not provide the same legal protection to your information.
OUR PRIVACY POLICY
In the course of providing you with our services and through your interactions with us, BBC Worldwide may collect information about you and about your use of our services. We are committed to being transparent in our handling of personal information and we endeavour to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws in the territories within which we operate. This policy describes the types of information we might collect, how we may use it and the circumstances in which we might disclose or transfer it.
If you have any questions or comments about this policy or our approach to privacy please contact us at dataprotection@bbc.com. We aim to reply to any queries within three working days.
1. SCOPE OF THIS POLICY AND YOUR CONSENT
This policy governs our processing of your information in relation to the products and services we supply to you. In addition to this policy, we operate policies relating to our use of Cookies (Tracking Technologies) and the provision of our services via Mobile Applications ("Mobile Apps"). The practices set out in those policies are governed by this overarching policy.
Please be aware that we also license our brands and content to other companies who may produce their own websites, events and digital content. We take reasonable steps to ensure that these companies clearly identify themselves and handle your information appropriately. However, when you use any service which is operated by a third party, the use of your information will be subject to their privacy policy and not ours. If you have any concerns, please contact us at: dataprotection@bbc.com.
Your use of our services constitutes your consent to the processing of your information described herein.
2. INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT
The type of information we collect will depend on the circumstances and the service you are using. For example, to sign up to a newsletter we may only need your name and email address but if you want to attend one of our events we may need to know your contact details, payment information and any access or dietary requirements. Generally speaking, we will collect information relating to you and/or your use of our services in the following ways:
PERSONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU :
This is usually information that identifies you as an individual or that enables us to contact you and can include your name, home and/or delivery address, telephone number, e-mail address, data of birth, demographical information, interests, preferences, payment information and photos or video footage. It can also include information that we have not requested but which you have volunteered, such as information provided during interactions with our customer service agents or via comments or other submissions you have made to our online services, such as online forums.
In some circumstances you might provide us with information about other individuals, for example when using a 'send to a friend' feature or submitting a photo that includes their image. You must ensure you (1) have their permission to provide their information to us; and (2) you have made them aware of the terms of this privacy policy.
INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY DURING YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES:
When you use our services we automatically record information about your usage of those services, your interaction with our adverts and our emails as well as information about the device you are using and your internet connection. We do this in two ways:
Log data: When you use our services, certain information gets recorded in our log files such as your device's Internet Protocol (IP) Address, its unique ID, its operating system and location, and your browser type, the pages you viewed, cookie information and referral links (the link that sent you to a particular page).
Tracking technologies (cookies): In conjunction with our log data we may use tracking technologies such as tags on our web pages and small data files which we store on your device (known as "cookies"). These technologies enable us to recognise your device and to track your interaction with our services, emails and adverts. We do not use these technologies to identify you and we do not intentionally collect or record personally identifiable information through these technologies. See our Cookies Policy for more information.
INFORMATION COLLECTED VIA SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES:
When you choose to participate in or receive a service from us via social media, for example by entering a competition or playing a game on our social pages, we may collect information from you directly or the social network may share with us personal information about you. This can consist of information such as your name, profile picture, gender, e-mail address and date of birth. Please keep in mind that any information provided to us via a third party may also be subject to that third party's privacy policy.
INFORMATION COLLECTED VIA SPECIALIST DATA COMPANIES:
We sometimes use specialist data companies to provide us with information they hold about you to enable us to better tailor our advertising. For example, we might use anonymous information about your browsing on other sites to enable us to infer your interests and to put you into appropriate "market segments". This information is not used to identify you as a person and we do not attempt to combine it with personally identifying information that we may hold. See our Cookies Policy for more information.
