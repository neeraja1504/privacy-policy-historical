Privacy Policy
We use Ezoic to provide personalization and analytic services on this website, as such Ezoic's privacy policy is in effect and can be reviewed here.
Your privacy is critically important to us. At Top Nonprofits we have a few fundamental principles:
We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law or protect our rights.
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.
Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: (Note, we’ve decided to make this privacy policy available under a  Creative Commons Sharealike  license, which means you’re more than welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own use, just make sure to replace references to us with ones to you, and if you want we’d appreciate a link somewhere on your site to TopNonprofits.com and Automattic.com (whose similarly licensed privacy policy was used to build this one).
