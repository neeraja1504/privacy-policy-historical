We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or services. Topspin automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, the page you requested, and the media you have consumed (e.g., viewed, played, downloaded, uploaded, and shared).
Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. This type of data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, (i) we may provide information to the content owners that relates to their fans (e.g., regarding which fans are consuming and sharing what pieces of media at what levels), and (ii) we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Website (e.g., we share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience).
When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site.

(13) CHILDREN’S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION
Some of our artist’s sites may be reasonably attractive to children. We do not intend to collect personal information from children under the age of 13, and if we find out we have collected this information, we will dispose of it immediately. Additionally, when our artists are aware that their music and other content may be reasonably attractive to children, we provide them with tools to ask for a user’s date of birth and prevent the collection of personal information from children under 13.
(14) HOW DO TOPSPIN WIDGETS WORK?
Our Website and data collection devices include "Widgets," which are interactive mini-programs that run on our artists’ sites to provide specific services from the artist (e.g. trading an email for a free song, purchasing an album, playing music, etc.). Personal information, such as your email address, may be collected through the Widget, which will subscribe you to an artist’s newsletter in exchange for a free song. Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function properly. Topspin Widgets collect the same personal information that may be collected by the Website, as described above. Topspin is the data processor of the personal information collected through these Widgets when the Widgets are on an artist’s site. However, because the artists are actually the controllers of this data, you should also refer to their privacy policy. Data is used by Topspin and the respective artists only for the purpose it is intended for.
Some of our Widgets have an "Email a friend" feature. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about an artist, we will ask you for your friend’s email address. The Widget will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.
Our Widgets also have a "share" feature. If you choose to use our share service to repost a Widget on another website, the third party website will request your login credentials (such as on Twitter or Facebook). The Widget will then automatically post the Widget on that website, which is governed by that third party website’s privacy policy.
(15) WHAT BEHAVORIAL TRACKING DATA DOES TOPSPIN COLLECT USING CLEAR GIFS (WEB BEACONS/WEB BUGS)?
Topspin and companies providing services to or on behalf of Topspin (such as advertising partners, affiliates, and exchanges) use web beacons/page tags (1x1 pixels), to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities when you visit the site. The data collected and tracked by the service is anonymous. Behavioral tracking information through web beacons does not collect, track, or require access to any personally identifiable information about any such visitors. This website uses web beacons to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone’s past visits to this website, or websites within advertising partners, affiliates, and/or exchanges. The data may include your location information associated with your IP address, web pages requested or viewed, date, time, domain and responses to advertisements. Information gleaned from your browser is automatically received and recorded.
Topspin and/or its service providers, affiliates, and exchanges collecting non-personally identifiable information may use this information to advertise to you. Topspin and companies providing services to or on behalf of Topspin (such as advertising partners, affiliates, and exchanges) may collect information about when your saw ads served to you and what ads you clicked on. Topspin and companies providing services to or on behalf of Topspin may also use and disclose non-personally identifiable data derived from our advertising campaigns for reporting purposes, for scheduling and optimization of content delivery and, of course, if they are required to do so by law.
(16) HOW TO OPT OUT OF CONSUMER BEHAVIORAL TRACKING
You may opt out by following the consumer opt-out instructions on the National Advertising Initiative's website. http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/
