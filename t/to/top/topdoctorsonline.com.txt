e. Services through the Site
You provide us with information during the process of using the Medisurge Technologies service. We break down users of our service into two categories, Clients and Experts (you may register as both a Client and an Expert). Clients must provide financial information such as a credit card number and expiration date in order to pay for and use the Medisurge Technologies service. Experts must provide contact information, like name and mailing address, in order to receive their payment from Medisurge Technologies. The information we collect from both Clients and Experts is to provide users with the best possible Medisurge Technologies service. If we have trouble providing that service, we may use contact information to get in touch with the user.
f. Member Client-Expert Communication Using the Medisurge Technologies Service
The main purpose of Medisurge Technologies is to allow registered Medisurge Technologies Experts to provide Clients with services that the Clients need. Experts and Members can negotiate and enter into a contract for a service using the Medisurge Technologies site. Certain communications may be recorded and maintained by Medisurge Technologies. Medisurge Technologies does not screen or edit the content of communications between Clients and Experts. Such communications are personal and private unless both parties agree to additional distribution. Information that is relayed between the Client and the Expert during either the negotiation phase of their relationship or during the actual relaying of service is kept completely confidential, and no other users of Medisurge Technologies have access to this information.
g. Publicly Accessible Information
Medisurge Technologies makes Public Boards (e.g. Q&A etc.) available to its registered users. The Public Boards allows members to post questions etc. that can be viewed by any Expert. All postings, descriptions, etc. are public to registered members and Experts. Medisurge Technologies clearly denotes to its users which communications are visible to all registered users and those that are visible to a specific, individual user only.
When you participate in a www.TopDoctorsOnline.com. Forum including, but not limited to, Titles, Posts, Votes, Discussion Boards, and Blog Comments, Your name and IP address may be recorded for purposes of maintaining Your own account within the Forums, and preventing abuses of the Forums. This information is not used to personally identify you outside the TopDoctorsOnline.com community. In order to diffuse the information in the Site's Forums to a wider audience, TopDoctorsOnline.com may, from time to time, collect some of your postings and group them together to use in a specific publication, print, electronic mailing or other public dissemination. At no point however will your name or IP address be revealed in any publication. In addition, when your postings are used in this fashion, they may be edited to fit with the general content of the publication being prepared. It is important to remember that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information in a forum, through e-mail or elsewhere, that information can be collected and used by others. If your personal information is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information.
Use of Information Available Through Medisurge Technologies
To ensure both Clients and Experts with the best service possible on our site, and to facilitate communication among Clients and Experts, Medisurge Technologies provides email addresses to Clients and Experts only under specific circumstances, including but not necessarily limited to participants involved in disputed and unpaid transactions. By reviewing Medisurge Technologies’ Terms of Service and approving Medisurge Technologies’ Legal Agreement, registered users of Medisurge Technologies agree to use the Public Board area and all communication facilities provided by Medisurge Technologies exclusively for interaction associated with Medisurge Technologies services and their delivery. Registered users may not use information gathered through a Medisurge Technologies transaction to defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or otherwise violate the legal and civil rights of any other registered user. Registered users may not use information gathered through a Medisurge Technologies transaction to sell any goods or services for any commercial purpose outside the scope of the Medisurge Technologies service. Email addresses and personal information may not be used to forward surveys contests, pyramid schemes or chain letters, or to post the same message repeatedly (a practice referred to as "spamming"). Medisurge Technologies may terminate the ability of any Client or Expert to use the Medisurge Technologies service.
