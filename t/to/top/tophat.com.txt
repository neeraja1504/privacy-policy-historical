Personal information does not include business contact information (for example, if you are an administrative user on behalf of an educational institution, your email address at the institution might not be deemed personal information). Personal information also does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about and through the use of our Web site and the THM Services and may include anonymized data which does not identify any individuals. Our privacy policy does not restrict or limit our collection and use of aggregate information or other types of non-personal information.
