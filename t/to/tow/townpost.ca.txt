Business Ads Permitted - Businesses are welcome to post classified ads free of charge for new or used products, clearance items, and store fixtures.

Posts that explicitly advertise another website, competing service, or we deem as a conflict of interest will be removed without notice. We reserve the right to filter, hide, or delete ads using our own editorial discretion. Ads posted advertising a services or business offers should be categorized under Business Ads / Services. If you are asking our visitors to go to another website, to a Facebook page, or the ad contains a link to external websites it must be a paid ad. Paid ads must also include descriptions, prices, and photos to avoid filtering in category pages.
