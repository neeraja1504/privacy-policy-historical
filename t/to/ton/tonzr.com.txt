Tonzr's Stance on Privacy
Last updated April 2nd, 2009.
We understand that you are placing great trust in Tonzr when entering your cell phone number on our site. It is currently Tonzr's stance to keep all of our visitors personal information safe and private. This means that as it stands, Tonzr will not provide anyone's cell phone number to our advertisers (or any other third party) in any way, shape, or form.
Additionally, Tonzr uses Google as a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit our website. Google may use information ( not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by Google, click here.
Of course, like every other site on the internet; although unlikely to happen, we reserve the right to change our stance on user privacy at any time. Any changes will be reflected on this page.
