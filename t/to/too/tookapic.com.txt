We must know to whom we provide it and have the opportunity to contact our users. We also process your data regarding the IP number, data stored in the cookie and in local storage.
Legal basis for data processing
The main basis for the processing of your personal data is a contract that you conclude with us by registering an account on our website. As we wrote above, if you do not provide your details, there will be no registration and as a result you cannot start your photo journey with Tookapic. A key element of the contract is also sending specific system notifications, such as a pop-up, which allows you to contact via chat or email about changing the terms of the Regulations or the Privacy Policy.
In addition to notifications, you will receive from time to time promotional newsletters from us and our partners. In this respect, the basis for processing is our legitimate interest - we must be able to contact our clients and perform work that will make our service even better. We will not do this if you oppose to it by using GDPR compliant panel https://tookapic.com/settings/preferences or by contacting hello@tookapic.com by email. We respect it.
