Privacy Policy
Your Privacy is Very Important to Us
At ToolGuyd, we recognize that the privacy of your personal information is of extreme importance. The following is information on the types of personal information that may be collected during your visit to toolguyd.com, and how we may use and safeguard that information.
Your information will not be shared in any way other than in the manner described below, and under absolutely no circumstances would it ever be sold to a third party.
Email
You are required to enter your email address when commenting to an entry or article – this is only done for anti-spam purposes. On rare occasion, ToolGuyd may chose to use this email address to respond to your comment or to contact you on an individual and case by case basis. The email address you enter in the comment form will never be added to any email list. If you are uncomfortable with the idea of submitting your real email address, feel free to make one up.
Should you send us an email directly or via our contact us form, we use your email address to direct our reply.
If you subscribe to any of our email lists, your email address will be collected. Your email address will be shared with Google, since we use their Feedburner service to deliver emails to these lists. You may opt-out of such lists at any time.
Comments
In order to leave a comment, you are asked to enter your name, which will be displayed with your comment, and your email address, which is not shared and is only used if we need to contact you on a case by case basis such as to answer a question.
We do collect IP addresses when you leave a comment, but such information is not shared with any external party. This information is collected for three reasons – to prevent spam, to ensure that giveaways are fair and that readers don’t enter multiple times under different aliases, and to catch corporate shills that hype-up their brands’ products.
Logs
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in server log files. The information in the log files may include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and the pages you visited throughout our site. IP addresses may also be collected whenever a comment or email is submitted to us via the comment or contact form interface.
