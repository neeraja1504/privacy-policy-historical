When you access our website, a cookie automatically saves information of a general nature. This information (server log files) includes, for example, the type of web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your Internet service provider and the like. This is the only information that does not allow conclusions about your person. This information is technically necessary to correctly deliver the contents of web pages requested by you and is mandatory when using the internet. They are processed in particular for the following purposes:
Ensure a stable connection to the site,

Evaluation of system security and stability as well as
for further administrative purposes.
The processing of your personal data is based on our legitimate interest for the aforementioned purposes of data collection. We do not use your information to draw conclusions about you. The recipient of the data is only the responsible body and possibly the processor.
Anonymous information of this kind may be statistically evaluated by us to optimize our website and the underlying technology.
Cookies
Like many other websites, we also use so-called "cookies". Cookies are small text files that are transferred from a website server to your hard drive. This automatically gives us certain data, such as IP address, browser used, operating system and your connection to the Internet.
Cookies can not be used to launch programs or to transfer viruses to a computer. Based on the information contained in cookies, we can facilitate navigation and enable the correct display of our websites. In no case will the data collected by us be passed on to third parties or a link with personal data will be established without your consent.

Registered users also have the option of changing or deleting the data specified during registration at any time.

Comment function
When users leave comments on our site, they will also be saved the time of their creation and the username previously chosen by the site visitor. This is for our security, as we may be prosecuted for any illegal content on our website, even if created by users.
Newsletter
On the basis of your expressly given consent, we will regularly send you our newsletter or comparable information by e-mail to your specified e-mail address.
For the receipt of the newsletter the indication of your E-Mail address is sufficient. When you sign up to receive our newsletter, the data you provide will be used exclusively for this purpose. Subscribers may also be notified by email about circumstances relevant to the service or registration (such as changes to the newsletter offer or technical conditions).
For an effective registration we need a valid e-mail address. In order to verify that an application is actually made by the owner of an e-mail address, we use the "Double opt-in" procedure. For this purpose we record the order of the newsletter, the dispatch of a confirmation mail and the receipt of the requested answer. Further data is not collected. The data will be used exclusively for the newsletter and will not be passed on to third parties.
The consent to the storage of your personal data and their use for the newsletter can be revoked at any time. Each newsletter has a link to it.

Contact forms
If you have questions of any kind contact us by e-mail or contact form, you give us your consent for the purpose of contacting you. This requires the specification of a valid e-mail address.

The information you provide will be stored for the purpose of processing the request and for possible follow-up questions. After completion of the request and expiration of any legal deadlines, personal data will be automatically deleted.
SSL encryption
To protect the security of your data during transmission, we use state-of-the-art encryption techniques (such as SSL) via HTTPS protocol.
Hyperlinks, links to third party websites
We give our members of the community the opportunity to link to their other offers via weblink. Therefore, there are so-called hyperlinks to websites of other providers on our website, which you can follow by clicking on them. In these cases, they will be redirected from our website directly to the other providers' website. You recognize this when the URL changes. Because we have an international offer, these sites may also be hosted outside the EU (e.g. in the US) where other privacy policies than GDPR may apply. We do not forward any data to the external website when the page is changed.
If you have been forwarded to the website of a member or other platform via hyperlink, the use of your data is subject to the privacy regulations of this company and the respective country. We can not take responsibility for the confidentiality of your personal information as we have no control over compliance with European data protection legislation. We are not responsible for the privacy practices used by such third party vendors or the information or content contained in their products and services. If you have any uncertainties, please contact the external website operator directly or the member who provides this link. This Privacy Policy applies only to data collected by us. We encourage you to read the third-party privacy policies before using their websites, products, or services.
Purposes of data processing by the responsible authority and third parties
We process personal data that we receive from our customers or users as part of our business relationship. In addition, we process - insofar as necessary for the provision of our services - personal data that we legitimately gain from publicly available sources (such as trade and association registers, press, internet) or that are transmitted to us by other third parties.
We process your personal data only for the purposes stated in this privacy policy. A transfer of your personal data to third parties for purposes other than those mentioned does not take place. We only share your personal information with third parties if:
You have given your explicit consent,
processing is required to complete a contract with you,
processing is required to fulfill a legal obligation
processing is necessary to protect legitimate interests and there is no reason to believe that you have an overriding legitimate interest in not disclosing your information.
We process personal data in accordance with the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG)
a. for the fulfillment of contractual obligations (Article 6 paragraph 1b GDPR)
The processing takes place in the context of the execution of our contracts with our customers and suppliers (artists) or for the execution of pre-contractual measures, on request by mail, telephone or post office, after registration with the Toon AgentÂ® (customers) or in the community portal toonpool.com (Suppliers).
b. in the context of the balancing of interests (Article 6 paragraph 1f of the GDPR)
If necessary, we process your data beyond the actual fulfillment of the contract to safeguard certain interests of us or third parties. Examples:

A given consent can be revoked at any time. This also applies to the revocation of declarations of consent, which were declared to us before the validity of the GDPR, i.e. before May 25, 2018. The revocation of consent is only effective for the future and does not affect the legality of the data processed until the revocation.
d. due to legal requirements (article 6 paragraph 1c GDPR) or in the public interest (article 6 paragraph 1e of the GDPR)
We process and store your personal data as long as this is necessary for the fulfillment of our contractual and legal obligations. If the data are no longer required for the fulfillment of contractual or legal obligations, these are regularly deleted, unless their temporary processing is necessary for the following purposes:
Fulfillment of commercial and tax-related retention requirements, e.g. from the German Commercial Code (HGB). The specified retention periods are usually up to 10 years.
Preservation of evidence in the context of the statutory statute of limitations (Â§195 German Civil Code)
As part of a business relationship with us, you must provide the personal information that is required to initiate, conduct, and terminate a business relationship and to fulfill its contractual obligations or that we are required to collect. Without this data, we will generally be unable to conclude, execute and terminate a contract with you.

This provider operates according to the rules of the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, which according to the adequacy decision of the EU Commission acc. Article 45 (3) GDPR provides an adequate level of data protection. We monitor this processing on a regular basis and may take action if the privacy policy changes. e-mails and mailings are transmitted via encrypted data transmission (SSL).
