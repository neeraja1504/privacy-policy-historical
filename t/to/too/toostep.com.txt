Like most web sites, TooStep uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows TooStep to recognize you as a user when you return to our site using the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use TooStep. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site.
One type of cookie, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set once you have logged in to your TooStep account. The next time you visit the TooStep web site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user so you will not need to log in before using the service. Additionally, if you log out of the TooStep site you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a "session" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the TooStep site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.
Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the TooStep web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave TooStep. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the TooStep service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is never shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law.
