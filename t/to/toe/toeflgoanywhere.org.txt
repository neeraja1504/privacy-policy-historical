ETS Legal: Privacy and Security
Educational Testing Service ("ETS") recognizes the importance of protecting your privacy. This Privacy Notice describes our practices related to personal information privacy and security.
ETS has a global privacy program to protect all "Personal Information." Personal Information is any information that we can use to identify you (such as your name, username or identification number) or contact you (such as your email address or telephone number). Personal Information includes other types of information (such as test scores or demographic data) when that information is associated with your Personal Information.
This Privacy Notice describes our practices with respect to Personal Information we collect via "Websites." The term "Website" includes all ETS websites, platforms and applications that collect personal information from you. It also describes our practices with respect to Personal Information collected in other ways, such as when you register for and take ETS tests, or when we receive information from a school or test center administrator. If you are a test taker, additional information about privacy and security is included in many of the ETS Test Bulletins.
By using an ETS Website or otherwise providing us with Personal Information, you agree to our privacy terms. You can contact us at any time with questions or concerns about privacy by sending an email to etsinfo@ets.org or by writing to us at the addresses in the Contact section below.
Within this Privacy Notice, you will find information about:

Information We Collect
We collect the following types of Personal Information from you when you use our Websites:
Contact Information that allows us to communicate with you, such as your name, username, mailing address, telephone numbers, email address or other addresses that allow us to send you messages.
Relationship Information that helps us do business with you. For test takers, this may include the types of tests that you want to take, your school affiliation, expected degree and graduation date, and similar information that can help us offer you personalized content. It may also include demographic data, such as language(s) spoken, which helps support ETS Research. For professionals, this may include your professional credentials and affiliations and the products and services that may interest you or your school. For test center administrators, they may include information about your relationship with your test center and the tests you administer.
Transaction Information about your activities with ETS, including your test registration records, test administration records, purchase history, order information about your use of our content (such as if you access your scores online, use test prep material or complete surveys), customer or TCA account information (such as if you email us for support) and payment card information as needed to process your payments.
In some cases, we may need to collect additional sensitive information from test takers and test center administrators in order to administer tests securely or to fulfill other requests that you may make. In particular:
As permitted by law, we collect biometric samples at the test center such as your photograph, fingerprint, voiceprint and/or writing samples. Please see the section on Biometric Identifiers below to learn more.
We may collect audio and video recordings in our test centers (including from premises monitoring equipment).
If you request an accommodation from us regarding test arrangements for medical or religious reasons, we may collect Personal Information relevant to your request. Similarly, if you request a fee waiver, fee reduction or scholarship, we may collect Personal Information about your financial situation. Providing Personal Information about your religion, disability or medical condition, and/or financial status is optional, but if you are requesting an accommodation from ETS, you must provide the information so that we can process your request.
In each case, we will only collect and use these types of Personal Information as permitted by law and as needed for ETS's legitimate business purposes, such as maintaining the integrity and security of our tests or processing your accommodation request.
When you visit and interact with our Website, we may also collect information that uses cookies and other data collection technologies. Please see the section on Cookies below to learn more. This Privacy Notice governs us when we associate the information we collect using cookies and other technology with your Personal Information.

How We Use Your Personal Information
We may use your Personal Information to:
Provide you with the products, content or services selected by you, such as to register you for and deliver tests, and send you service-related communications, such as identity verification, score delivery, customer service and account management.
Subject to your choices, provide you with marketing communications, surveys and offers for products and services from ETS and our partners, including personalized offers based on your usage of our products and to manage your communications preferences.
Improve our products and services (including for test usability and design, security and research), and to identify, develop and offer new or expanded products and services.
Understand how you use our products, content and services, including associating you with different devices that you may use to access our content, to help personalize your experience on the Website, and customize the content and/or format of the pages you visit.
Manage our everyday business needs, such as payment processing and financial account management, test center management, contract management, Website administration, business continuity and disaster recovery, security and fraud prevention, corporate governance, reporting and legal compliance.
Generate aggregate statistical studies and conduct research ourselves or jointly with others related to our products and services and the use of our Website.
We may also use your Personal Information in other ways, if you consent to those uses.

Biometric Identifiers
Where permitted by law, ETS uses biometric data to identify and authenticate test takers and test center administrators. ETS collects digital photographs and digital voice recordings, and coverts these samples into mathematical representations called templates, which can be compared to the templates previously collected by ETS. ETS uses these templates solely to support test security and integrity and for related purposes (such prosecution of fraud or intellectual property theft). Biometric templates are securely stored and only accessible to those individuals and entities who reasonably need access to the data in connection with investigations, compliance and security.
Back to Top
Use of Information by ETS Research
ETS uses anonymized and pseudonymized information for various research initiatives. For example, ETS may consider how certain types of test takers (such as nonnative English speakers) respond to specific test questions. Similarly, educational apps, such as MyTurnToRead, collect data to help ETS understand and improve reading skills. ETS's research initiatives reflect our commitment to fairness and equity in testing, helping to ensure that our tests are accessible and free from bias. They also seek to improve teaching, learning and assessment.
ETS may process Personal Information as needed to create de-identified datasets for research. ETS will not (and will not permit any third party to) associate identifying information with research data. Our research results do not contain any identifiable data, and research data are not used to target or profile individuals.

Disclosure of Your Personal Information
We will only disclose your Personal Information as follows:
We may disclose your Personal Information to our affiliates, who will only use your Personal Information for the purposes listed above.
We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties that provide services to us. For example, when you register for a test, we will provide certain registration information to third parties that administer the tests in your area. We use service providers for other functions as well, including data hosting and other business activities such as printing, mailing and/or payment processing. We require such third-party processors to use your Personal Information in accordance with our instructions, and they may not use your Personal Information for their own purposes.
We may disclose your Personal Information as needed to provide services to you. For example, you may instruct us to disclose your test scores to schools and others. We may also share your Personal Information with our partners, but only to the extent that you have a relationship with such partner or you authorize the sharing. For example, we may share information with test prep providers, if you elect to use the materials or as needed to validate referrals and operate the platforms.
We may also disclose Personal Information in accordance with applicable law, in connection with any sale or transfer of our business or assets, to assert or defend our rights and property, or to prevent harm to others. For example, we may disclose Personal Information to third parties when we investigate claims of misconduct or other incidents that may occur in our test centers. We will also always disclose Personal Information when required to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, including to law enforcement agencies and courts in the United States and other countries where we operate.
Please note that we may also use and disclose information about you that is not personally identifiable. For example, we may publish reports that contain aggregated and statistical data. These reports do not contain any Personal Information.
