We and some of our third party service providers use cookies on our Website. A cookie is a small text file written by an Internet server to a website user's browser where information is exchanged between them, and which is stored on a computer's hard drive to allow us to recognize and track users on our Website to assist us in providing users with a productive online experience. Cookies enable us to store information about your use of our Website such as the areas you visit and the length of your stay. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies and can be reset by using the "Help" portion of the toolbar to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.

We may also use a third party to help us gather and analyze information about the areas that you visit on the Website to evaluate and improve the customer experience and the convenience of the Website, and to help us evaluate some of the specific information that you provide to us.
In addition to the foregoing, we may also work with business partners that use tracking technologies to deliver advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to our Website and your interaction with our communications.
As mentioned above, the information we collect is used to improve our Website, to personalize your online experience, to help us deliver information to you and to determine the effectiveness of our advertising, and for other internal business purposes.

We may pass along information about your shopping cart choices, purchases and preferences to our marketing, customer service or other departments, as appropriate. They may use this information to offer products and services to you consistent with the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy.
Credit card and financing information may be provided to credit card and consumer financing companies as is required to process applications and transactions.
We may also share certain personal information we collect about you with third parties who perform services for us or with whom we contract for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may use third parties to host our Website, operate certain of its features, send emails, print or send mailings, conduct customer research, authorize and process your payments, manage and analyze data and our advertising effectiveness, and fulfill gift card orders. These third-party service providers are given the information that they need to perform their designated functions and we do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information for their own or any others' marketing purposes.
On rare occasions we may also be required to disclose your information as is required by law pursuant to lawful requests such as subpoenas, court or agency orders, or as we may reasonably determine to be necessary to protect our rights or the rights of others, to avert harm to persons or property, or to enforce this Privacy Policy.
Your information may also be transferred as an asset in connection with a merger or sale (including any transfer made as part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings) involving all or part of AGN’s business or as part of a corporate reorganization, stock sale or other change in corporate control.
Our Website may also contain links to other sites that are not owned or operated by AGN. These include links to sites hosted by our service providers or partners where, for example, they provide security services or administer promotional programs. Also, links to our Website may be featured on other websites on which we advertise.

How do we protect your information?
We employ various security measures designed to help protect the personal information that we collect from you online. For example, we use Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) encryption technology to protect the security of your credit card and personal information as it is transmitted to us. We have instituted firewalls to help protect our servers and network. Unfortunately, no collection or transmission of information over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and therefore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any such information.
