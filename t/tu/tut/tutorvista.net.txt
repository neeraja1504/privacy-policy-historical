TutorVista.com has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on the TutorVista.com web site (the "Site") is of great importance to us. Because we gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have established this Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change this Statement at any time, so please visit TutorVista.com regularly to review our privacy statement.
If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact the Privacy Program Office of TutorVista.com by emailing care@tutorvista.com., or by 24X7 online chat.
Collected Information
We require customers who register to use the services offered on our Site (collectively, the "Service") to give us contact information, such as their name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the school grade and subjects to use the service. We also receive and may store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses www.tutorvista.com. More information on our use of "cookies" can be found below.
TutorVista.com uses the information that we collect to set up the Service for our customers. We may also use the information to contact customers to further discuss customer interest in our company, the Service that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. Customer email addresses and any personal customer information will not be distributed or shared with third parties. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by sending an email to care@tutorvista.com. Separately, customers are also asked to provide an email address when registering for the Service, in order to receive a username and password. We may also email information regarding updates to the Service or company, and will send a Customer Newsletter.
In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services (including registration), we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, experience with our products and services, and more detailed contact preferences. Customers and visitors always have the option of choosing not to provide us with this information.
Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, we do not disclose to third parties the information provided. All financial and billing information that we collect through the Site is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for the Service. This billing information is not used by TutorVista.com for marketing or promotional purposes. TutorVista.com uses a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card processing. This intermediary uses the information for the sole purpose of credit card processing.
TutorVista.com may also collect certain information from visitors to and customers of the Site, such as Internet addresses. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Site in order to constantly improve the quality of the Service. We may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.
Special Relationships
TutorVista.com has a number of relationships with business partners with whom we may share your personal information for the purpose of providing a service, fulfilling an order or completing a transaction. For example, we use certain vendors for the purpose of providing credit card transaction and check processing services. These vendors verify your purchase information, such as credit card number or checking account number, and authorize your transaction. In doing so, they have access to data about users, but they are prohibited from using this information for any other purpose. We also strongly urge you to read the privacy policy of our business partner at the business partners site.

All information gathered on the site is stored and maintained in secure facilities that limit access to authorized personnel only.
