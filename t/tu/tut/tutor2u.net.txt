Legal grounds for using your personal data
We will only use your personal data where we have a legal ground to do so. We determine the legal grounds based on the purposes for which we have collected and used your personal data. In every case, the legal ground will be one of the following:
Consent  from you .  For example, where you have provided your consent to receive marketing emails from us. You can withdraw your consent at any time. In the case of marketing emails you can withdraw your consent by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email or through your email preferences, when signed into your tutor2u account.
Our legitimate interests.  Where it is necessary for us to understand our customers, improve our services and communications, and operate our website efficiently and securely, for the benefit of customers and website users. For example, we will rely on our legitimate interest when we analyse what content has been viewed on our website, so that we can understand how it is used. It is also in our legitimate interest to carry out marketing analysis to determine what products and services may be relevant to the interests of our customers.
Performance of a contract  with you, or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract with you. For example, where you have purchased a product from us and we need to use your contact details and payment information in order to process and fulfil your order.
Compliance with law. In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to use or keep your personal data.

How we share the data we collect
We  do  share personal data with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested or communicate on your behalf. For example, if you request our 'Invoice my school' payment option, we may share your name, email address and position when we contact the school to seek authorisation.
We  do  share personal data with a limited number of third party vendors and service providers who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service. Our vendors perform services such as payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, statistical analysis, and other similar services.
We may share your personal data with third-parties under the following circumstances:
We are compelled to do so to meet a legal or regulatory obligation, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of anyone else.
We are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If this happened, we would use reasonable efforts to try to make sure that the organisation we transfer your personal data to uses it in line with our privacy policy.
We  do not  share, sell, rent, or trade personal data with any third-parties for their own marketing or commercial purposes, except where you have specifically told us to.

Using children’s personal data
We do not aim any of our products or services directly at children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal data about children under 13.

Security of your personal data
We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational controls to protect your personal data against unauthorised processing and against accidental loss, damage or destruction.
You are responsible for choosing a secure password when we ask you to set up a password to access parts of our website. You should keep this password confidential and you should choose a password that you do not use on any other site. You should not share your password with anyone else, including anyone who works for us.
Unfortunately, sending information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data once with us, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal data sent to our site while still in transit and so you provide it at your own risk.

International data transfers
As part of the services offered to you through our website, the information which you give to us may be transferred to countries out of the European Economic Area (EEA).
For example, some of our third-party providers (such as our web server hosts and cloud-storage hosts) may be located outside of the EEA. Where this is the case we will take steps to make sure the right security measures are taken so that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this policy. By submitting your personal data, you’re agreeing to this transfer, storing or processing.
Where our third-party providers are in the United States (US) we have ensured that their services fall under the "Privacy Shield" whereby participating companies are deemed to have adequate protection and therefore facilitate the transfer of information from the EEA to the US.
If you use our services while you are outside the EEA, your information may be transferred outside the EEA to give you those services.

How long we keep your personal data
We keep your personal data for as long as we need it for the purposes for which it was collected.
When we decide how long we will keep your information we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure, why we need it, and any relevant legal requirements.
We may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely.
When you unsubscribe from marketing communications, we will keep your email address to ensure that we do not send you any marketing in future.

Email communications
We may send you service emails, for example, when you create an account, reminding you of an upcoming event you're attending, or confirming an order you've placed. You may not opt out of these emails.
Periodically, we may also send you other product updates and announcements by email. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences when you are signed in to your tutor2u account.
We also offer a range of other email alerts and subject-specific newsletters. Again, you can manage your subscription to these emails when you are signed in to your tutor2u account.

Essential website cookies:  These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our website and to use some of its features, such as access to restricted content. Refusal of these cookies may impact website functionality.
Performance and functionality cookies:  These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our website but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.

Your rights to data access and control
You can contact us with regard to the following rights in relation to your personal data:
You would like to have a copy of the personal data we hold on you or if you think that we hold incorrect personal data about you. We will deal with requests for copies of your personal data or for correction of your personal data within one month. If your request is complicated or if you have made a large number of requests, it may take us longer. We will let you know if we need longer than one month to respond. You will not have to pay a fee to obtain a copy of your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
Where applicable, you may also have a right to receive a machine-readable copy of your personal data for easier portability.
You also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data or restrict how it is used. There may be exceptions to the right to erasure for specific legal reasons which, if applicable, we will set out for you in response to your request. Where applicable, you have the right to object to processing of your personal data for certain purposes.
If you want to make any of these requests, please email privacy@tutor2u.net or write to Fiona Harris (Data Protection Officer) at Tutor2u Limited, 214 High Street, Boston Spa, West Yorkshire, LS23 6AD.
