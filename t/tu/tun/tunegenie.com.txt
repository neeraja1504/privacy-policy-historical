Information We Collect and How We Use It
When and if you subscribe to services like newsletters, alerts, special invitations or promotions or download certain software or plug-ins that may be made available by us through our Site, we may use your e-mail address or other contact information to send the information that you requested.
When you participate in a promotional feature, we may ask for your name, home or work address, telephone number and e-mail address so we can administer the promotion. We may share this information with business partners of ours participating in or supporting the promotion.
When you click on a banner advertisement or other link on our Site, you pass through our web server before arriving at your destination website. We track click-throughs to help us determine your interest in particular topics, measure the effectiveness of our customer communications, and to help market our Site to advertisers or potential business partners.
We may personalize your experience by using your site behavior to shape any recommendations we may make about music files, CDs, videos and other merchandise or content (including advertising) that might be of interest to you. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and Site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the Site.
We use "cookies" and other tracking technologies for the purposes described above as well as to enhance the functionality of the Site. This information may be stored in files on your computer that we access. For example, when you visit our Site, we may use the information stored in a cookie to store a password so that you do not have to continually input it every time you move to a different section of a password-protected portion of our Site or use a cookie from a previous visit to facilitate your use of our Site and to track usage.
We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to our Site, new services we provide, and special offers we think will be of interest to you.

Likes cannot be deselected and if compatible with affiliates sites may be viewed on those affiliate sites.
We may collect anonymous demographic information that is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, domicile, age, gender, preferences and interests. We may use this information in aggregate with affiliates, advertisers, business partners or unaffiliated third parties for the purpose of performing business services for us. We may transfer information we have about you in connection with the sale of all or part of our business. We reserve the right to disclose personal information to regulatory authorities, law enforcement agencies or as required by applicable law.
