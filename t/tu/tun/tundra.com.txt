Privacy Policy
Your privacy is very important to us. Integrated Device Technology (“IDT”) adheres to the following privacy policy regarding its collection, use and dissemination of personal and non-personal information collected through its website (idt.com).
Collection of Non-Personal Information
Whenever you visit a web page on the internet, your browser automatically identifies the IP address from where your page request was initiated. It also volunteers certain basic information like browser type, the operating system you are running, and in some cases the page from which you referred to the Site.  IDT’s server automatically collects this information and tracks it on a page by page and on a statistical basis.  Our server also collects: date and time of visit; web page viewed; country, region, city, and company from where a page request was initiated; whether our site was accessed from a bookmark or link; search keywords used; and the referring URL.
Use of Non-Personal Information
IDT uses non-personal information such as the region or country of the world from which your IP request emerged to suggest the appropriate language presentation or to select the best promotion aligned to that region of the world. We also use browser type, operating system, and page visits for statistical analysis of site usage and navigation trends.
Collection of Personal Information
When you create your personal preferences at IDT, we will ask for your name, title, company name, e-mail address, mail address and IDT product preferences. IDT also uses “Cookies” to collect personal information about our visitors.
