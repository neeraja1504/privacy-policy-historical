how is my information shared with other communities?
TuneWiki currently provides a number of Gadgets which you can use in connection with other online communities you may be a part of, such as MySpace and Facebook. The Plugin interacts, communicates and shares information across and between each Gadget you choose to incorporate into your online community accounts. If you there are updates to your information at TuneWiki, your information will be automatically shared, updated and populated across all installed Gadgets.
For example, if you’ve chosen to place a Gadget on your MySpace page, any information you make available to TuneWiki users will be seamlessly updated at your Gadget at MySpace and, accordingly, made available to anyone who can view your MySpace page. For this reason, if you choose to use Gadgets, you should consider the information you make available on TuneWiki as available to all the online communities where you’ve installed Gadgets.
You should also note that these online communities are not affiliated with TuneWiki and subject to their own privacy policies and user agreements, which have not been reviewed or approved by us. In each case, it will be your responsibility to review how your Personal Information is used, collected, stored and shared under each online community’s terms and conditions. We are not responsible for your use of or inability to use any online community or Gadget installed at such online community, including, without limitation, the manner in which such online community may interact with the installed Gadget.
what about information I post to TuneWiki, including any forums, chats or blogs?
If you chose to upload or edit lyrics in the TuneWiki database, use a forum, import a blog, participate in a chat room or otherwise use a feature available through the Service, you should be aware that any Personal Information you post can be read, collected or used by other users of the Service (and users of online communities if you use Gadgets), and could be used to send you unsolicited messages or in an otherwise unauthorized manner. We cannot be responsible for any Personal Information you choose to post through those means and we recommend careful consideration before you post such information.
how can I view, update or remove my information?
We do not provide you the ability to view or update information we may have in our database. However, if you want us to remove your Personal Information from our database, please remove the Plugin from your mobile device or personal computer. Personal Information related to the Plugin should be deleted the next time our servers are updated, however, any attribution made to you in connection with lyrics you post or edit will remain in the TuneWiki database. Please note that if you choose to reinstall the Plugin, we will once again have your Personal Information stored in our database and you will need to once again remove the Plugin to remove your Personal Information from our servers.
Please note that after your Personal Information is removed, there may be residual information that remains within one of our databases that may or may not contain your Personal Information, such as information that may be retained in back-up servers or records we may retain for a period of time to comply with legal or industry requirements or with legal process served on us, to protect and defend our rights or property, or in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of any individual. We will not authorize any third party to access or use this residual information on a Personal Information level for any commercial purpose.
what choices do I have about the Service?
If you have any objection to the manner we collect, use and share your information, you must remove the Plugin from your mobile device or personal computer and discontinue using the Service. Your continued use of TuneWiki constitutes your complete acceptance of this Privacy Policy.
what about security?
Protecting the security of your information is very important to us. You acknowledge that wireless transmissions are not secure by nature. However, once we receive your transmission, we will take reasonable precautions to secure and protect the information on our systems. Within our systems, your Personal Information is protected by a “firewall” (a combination of computer hardware and software that helps keep unauthorized visitors from accessing information within our computer network). Unfortunately, no data transmission over mobile networks or the Internet can be 100% secure and, accordingly, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us via wireless means, online or otherwise.
does TuneWiki use cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies? what about third party cookies?
We currently do not place or use cookies at our website, but we do employ web beacons; however, we may use cookies in the future. Web beacons (also called “pixel tags”) are small strings of code placed on a web page or within an email for the purpose of transferring information. We and our web analytics provider may employ web beacons placed on the pages of our website to help us learn things such as what kinds of users our website attract, which lyrics most interest our users, and what kinds of content our users like to see. Web beacons are also used to aggregate your data across communities through Gadgets.
With respect to mobile devices, we use GPS technology to provide and associate location-based information to the songs you listen to.
what about other websites, services and communities?
Please be aware that when you are using the Service or our website, you could be directed via hyperlinks or other means to third-party websites, services and online communities that are not affiliated with TuneWiki. These websites, services and online communities may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data or solicit your Personal Information. The privacy policies of these websites, services and online communities may be very different from this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other websites, services and online communities and cannot guarantee the security of any of your Personal Information collected, used or shared there.
what is your policy regarding children?
You must be 13 or older to use TuneWiki; we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database. If you are between 13 and 17, you agree that you received your parent or legal guardian’s consent to use and access TuneWiki.
what about international users?
TuneWiki is controlled, operated and administered by us from our offices and servers located within the United States. We make no representation that TuneWiki is appropriate or available for use at other locations outside of the United States or that our collection, use or sharing of data complies with the laws of foreign jurisdictions. If you access or use TuneWiki from a location outside of the United States, you are solely responsible for complying with all local laws. ****
