Turtle Beach® Privacy Policy
SHARING YOUR INFORMATION & THIRD PARTY PARTNERSHIPS
On occasion, Turtle Beach may share personal information collected from the Site with selected third-party companies who assist Turtle Beach in providing products and services or in advertising, marketing and website analytics efforts or allow such third-party companies to collect personal information directly from the Site. Such information may include your name, address, email address and purchase information, which will help arrange product delivery, provide customer support or target marketing communications. Such third parties have agreed to keep such information confidential and not use it to send advertisements or other communications on behalf of anyone other than Turtle Beach and its affiliates.
Turtle Beach does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Turtle Beach or the third-party companies that assist us with marketing may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your personal information is not transferred to the third party.
**Co-Branding  **
Turtle Beach may enter into a "co-branding" relationship with another company or organization. At times, we may communicate with customers on behalf of that company and customers may be directed to a partner website to purchase a specific item or learn about their services. In these cases, both Turtle Beach and the partner company may receive personal information you provide and you should refer to the privacy policy of the "co-branding" partner to learn about how they handle your personal information.
**Links from the Site to Third-Party Websites  **
The Site may contain links to third-party websites. Turtle Beach is not responsible for the content or the collection or use of personal information by such third-party websites. Please refer to the privacy policies of the third-party website to learn about how they handle your personal information.
Links to the Site from Third-Party Websites
Turtle Beach may use outside marketing companies to place advertisements or links to the Site on third-party websites. The marketing company or the operator of such third-party website may collect information about people who click on an advertisement for or link to the Site. Turtle Beach is not responsible for the collection or use of information by such marketing companies or third-party websites. Please refer to their privacy policies to learn about how they handle your personal information.
Merger or Acquisition; Legal Compliance
In the event that Turtle Beach is merged with or acquired by another company, or in the event of a transfer of our assets, we may disclose or transfer personal information and other information about usage of the Site in connection with such a transaction. You should also be aware that courts may have the authority under certain circumstances to permit personal information and other information about usage of the Site to be shared or transferred to third parties without your permission.
