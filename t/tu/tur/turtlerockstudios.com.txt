De-Personalizing Your Information
We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable.  This process is known as de-personalizing your information.  You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect on the Site and TRS Services (the “ ** Analytical Data** ”).  We are expressly authorized to make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties.
Cookies  and other Technical Information
In addition to any personal information or other information that you choose to submit to us via the TRS Services, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Site and/or TRS Services (“ ** Usage Information ”).  This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “ ** Device ”) whenever you visit or interact with the Site and/or TRS Services.  To the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Site and/or TRS Services, we will treat it as personal information.
“Cookies” are small bits of electronic information that a website sends to a visitor’s browser and are stored on the visitor’s hard drive.  Like many websites, we employ cookies in certain areas of the Site to allow us to provide information to make your online experience more convenient and to enhance your experience with the Site.  For example, when you return to the Site after logging in, cookies provide information so that the Site will remember who you are on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of the Site by, for instance, tailoring content to you.  A user may configure his or her web browsers to accept or reject or delete the cookies, or notify the user when a cookie is being set.
We may collect other Usage Information from users of the Site and/or TRS Services, including their IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, and geolocational information.
Web Beacons
We employ third party tracking utility software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.  In short, clear gifs enable two websites to share information with one another.  We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information.
Tracking Pixel
A tracking “pixel” is a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a web page and allows for the collection of information regarding the use of the web page that contains the tracking pixel. TRS uses third party ad servers to support tracking pixels and cookies.
Third Party Tools
Our Site uses the following third party website tracking tools to help us learn about who visits our site and what pages are being viewed. Please click on the links below to learn more about these vendors and their privacy policies:

Social Media Features
Our Site interfaces with social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus and others.  If you choose to log in to your account on the Site through those social media sites, then TRS may access your information on those sites and import, use, and share your “friends” list or contacts from those sites.  If you choose to “like” or share personal information through those services, you should review the privacy policy of that service.  Those social media sites may collect your IP address or set cookies.  If you are a member of a social media site, the interfaces may allow the social media site to connect and view your personally identifiable information.  In addition, we may provide third-party sites’ interfaces or links on the TRS Services to facilitate your sending a communication from the TRS Services.  For example, we may use third parties to facilitate emails, tweets or Facebook postings.  Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices.  You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on the Site and/or TRS Services.
Tracking Technologies Usage.  We may use tracking technologies for a variety of purposes, including:

_          Tracking Technologies Choices and Consent.  _We obtain your consent to our information storage or collection tracking technologies by providing you with transparent information in our Privacy Policy and providing you with the opportunity to make a choice to disable cookies as set forth above.  Please note that we are not required to obtain your consent to the information collection Tracking Technologies identified above that are strictly necessary.  If you are a resident of Europe, you may have the right to object to other use of information storage or collection technologies.

Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third party web sites or online services (e.g., browser do not track signals).  Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these do not track signals or other mechanisms.
