5. The basis for processing your data and how we use that data
1. Legitimate interests
We may process your personal data because it is necessary for our or a third party's legitimate interests. This will always be weighed against your rights, interests and expectations. Our legitimate interests include the operation of Turn2us in accordance with our charitable objects.
Examples of where we process personal data in accordance with our legitimate interests include:
To correspond with you about our charitable services, including details of events and of our welfare services, that you have requested from us;
To process donations and payments, and to ask for further support by post or telephone if you have done so in the past;
To provide tailored information/results to you through the Benefits Calculator, Helpline or Turn2us Connect service (unless we are required to obtain your explicit consent, for example in respect of medical information – see below);
To evaluate whether you may qualify for a grant (either from Turn2us or from another charity to which we may assist you in applying) and to process and record your grant application, and make any payments as applicable;
To inform you of media opportunities, potentially, and of opportunities to write or feature in newsletter and other Turn2us content, and to send you these newsletters and other similar updates from time to time;
Processing technical information about your use of our website to ensure that content on our website is presented in the most effective manner;
Processing enquiries and complaints;
Tailoring our communications to supporters (see further below).
Carry out research and analysis, either in house or via a third party, of the services we provide so that we can improve these in future
Building profiles of our supporters and targeting communications
We may use profiling and analytical techniques to ensure communications are relevant and timely, and to provide an improved experience for our supporters.  Analysis also allows us to target our resources effectively, which donors consistently tell us is a key priority for them. We do this because it allows us to understand who, how and why people support us and helps us to make appropriate requests to supporters who may be able and willing to give more than they already do. Importantly, it enables us to raise more funds, sooner, and more cost-effectively, than we otherwise would.
When building a profile,we may analyse giving history, geographic, demographic and other information relating to you in order to better understand your interests and preferences in order to contact you with the most relevant communications. In doing this, we may use additional information from third party sources when it is available. Such information is compiled using publicly available data about you, for example addresses, listed directorships or typical earnings in a given area. Please let us know if you are a supporter and would prefer us not to undertake such profiling. (See Contact details below.)
2. Legal obligations
We may also process your personal data for our compliance with our legal obligations. In this respect, we may use your personal data to comply with subject access requests of others, tax legislation (including processing Gift Aid claims), safeguarding requirements (for example those required by the Charity Commission), for the prevention and detection of crime, and in order to assist the police and other competent authorities with investigations (including criminal investigations).
3. Consent
In some circumstances Turn2us may seek your specific consent to process your personal data: for example:
If we wish to use your name, likeness or an attributed quote in our newsletter, on our website or in marketing materials or as a case study to demonstrate the impact of our work;
Sending marketing communications in relation to appeals, our services, events and resources by, electronic mail and SMS, in respect of which we operate an ‘opt-in’ communications policy;
As part of our Benefits Calculator/Turn2us Connect/Helpline/Grants Search/Grant-giving services, where we ask for medical/health information (‘special category data’ for which your explicit consent is required for processing) in order to provide you with the calculations and information you require;
When working with charity, public sector or corporate partners where we have a relationship that we believe could help your financial or personal circumstances.
We will normally seek consent when processing your medical information in other contexts, such as dietary requirements for events. At times, the processing of personal data concerning your health may be necessary to protect your vital interests (such as your immediate safety) and it may not be appropriate to seek your consent in such circumstances.
If you have given your consent and you wish to withdraw it, please contact us using the contact details below. Please note that where our processing of your personal data does not rely on your consent, we may not be able to fulfil your request (please see Your Rights section below).

8. Retention of your data
We may retain your personal data for as long as it is necessary to deliver our charitable services; and to protect our legal interests (for example where required by relevant authorities or for a reasonable legal limitation period after we have ceased providing grant funding or services); or as otherwise stated to you when your data is collected; or for such period as we reasonably consider appropriate in connection with our relationship with you and/or the organisation you represent/ed; or for record-keeping and archival purposes.

9. International transfers
As a matter of course, we do not transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) with the exception of organisations that adhere to the Privacy Shield Framework. We may, however, transfer your personal data around the world on an ad hoc basis, for example where this is necessary for interaction with you and you are located outside of the EEA. In such circumstances, we will consider whether any additional measures are required in order to give adequate protection for the information when it is transferred outside of the EEA.

You have the following rights:

To require us not to send you direct marketing communications;
To require us to correct the personal data we hold about you if it is inaccurate;
To require us (in certain circumstances) to erase your personal data;

To receive from us the personal data we hold about you which you have provided to us, in a reasonable format specified by you, including for the purpose of you transmitting that personal data to another data controller; and
To object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to any of our particular processing activities where you feel this has a disproportionate impact on your rights.
Please note that the above rights are not absolute and we may be entitled to refuse requests where exceptions apply: for example if we have reason to believe the personal data we hold is accurate or we can show our processing is necessary for a lawful purpose set out in this Privacy Notice.
You can find out more about your rights under data protection legislation at the Information Commissioner' Office website.
