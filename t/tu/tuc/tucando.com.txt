Online Privacy Policy
Tucando
This privacy policy applies to all personal information collected by Tucando via the internet.
Tucando recognises the importance of your privacy, and that you have a right to control how your personal information is collected and used. We know that providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that seriously. Unless you directly give us consent to do otherwise, Tucando will only collect and use your personal information as set out below.
Collection of information
The four main ways we collect personal information about you are:
when information about you is posted on a Tucando website, either by you or by a third party;
when you log into a Tucando website or otherwise submit personal information to Tucando;
when you use a Tucando website, in which case our system automatically collects information relating to your visit to that website, such as your IP address;
The type of information that we collect from you may include the following: your name, phone number, address, email address, company position/title, credit card details, IP address, cookies, personal information that you include in your business listing or personal information that you email/send using email functionality on the Bizebees.com website.
Our use of cookies
Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record keeping purposes.

Using and disclosing your personal information
Our purpose in collecting information about you is to:
provide you with a better service experience with content and advertising that is more relevant to your interests; and
create a business information database for use as part of Tucando's online business. Whilst Tucando's business information database is designed to operate as a business directory (not a directory of individuals) it is possible that personal information may become included in the business information database.
Tucando will not use or disclose any information about you without your consent, unless:
the use or disclosure is for one of the purposes described above or otherwise permitted by this policy;
it is required or permitted by law (including by relevant privacy laws);
we believe it necessary to provide you with a service which you have requested;
to protect the rights, property or personal safety of another Tucando website user, any member of the public or Tucando; or any of the assets and/or operations of Tucando are being transferred to another party.
If you do not provide requested information, Tucando may not be able to provide you with access to or full use of sections of the Tucando website.
