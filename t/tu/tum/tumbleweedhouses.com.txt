When you want FREE items you will be asked for your PII, Company, Suite or Apartment number and phone are optional.

Defined by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, the standard was created to increase controls around credit card data to reduce credit card fraud via its exposure. Our website takes these measures to protect your credit and debit data: Maintain a Secure Network, Protect Cardholder Data, Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program, Implement Strong Access Control Measures, Regularly Monitor and Test Networks, and Maintain an Information Security Policy.

When Tumbleweed Discloses Your Information Tumbleweed takes your privacy very seriously. Tumbleweed does not sell or rent your contact information to other marketers. To help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared with legal entities within our corporate group globally who will take steps to safeguard it in accordance with our privacy policy.
There are also times when it may be advantageous for Tumbleweed to make certain personal information about you available to companies that Tumbleweed has a strategic relationship with or that perform work for Tumbleweed to provide products and services to you on our behalf. These companies may help us process information, extend credit, fulfill customer orders, deliver products to you, manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service, assess your interest in our products and services, or conduct customer research or satisfaction surveys. In such situation these companies are prohibited from using your personal information for any unauthorized purposes and are also obligated to protect your information in accordance with Tumbleweed’s policies, except if we inform you otherwise at the time of collection. Without such information being made available, it would be difficult for you to purchase products, have products delivered to you, receive customer service, provide us feedback to improve our products and services, or access certain services, offers, and content on our web site.
Tumbleweed may take the personal information we receive from individuals responding to our customer surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we may have, to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). Tumbleweed then uses the aggregated information to improve the quality of its services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated nonpersonally identifying information may be shared with third parties.
We also reserve the right to disclose your personal information for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including credit agencies, collection agencies, merchant database agencies, law enforcement, litigation or to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information. We may also disclose personal information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our contracts, policies and procedures. Finally we may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary.
We also may disclose PII to attorneys, collection agencies, or law enforcement authorities to address potential AUP violations, other contract violations, or illegal behavior. And we disclose any information demanded in a court order or otherwise required by law or to prevent imminent harm to persons or property. Finally, we may share PII in connection with a corporate transaction, like a merger or sale of our company, or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or of the product or service line you received from us, or a bankruptcy.
As noted above, we compile Website usage statistics from data collected through cookies. We may publish those statistics or share them with third parties, but they don’t include PII.
Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not share PII with third parties. We will never share, sell, or rent individual personal information with anyone for their promotional use without your advance permission or unless ordered by a court of law. Information submitted to us is only available to our employees managing this information for purposes of contacting you or sending you emails based on your request for information, and to contracted service providers for purposes of providing services relating to our communications with you.
Protection of PII We employ the following data security tools to protect Personally Identifiable Information: Our web sites use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required and to make online purchases you must use an SSL-enabled browser in order to protect the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it’s transmitted over the Internet. You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet.
NOTE: Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure web browser. Unfortunately, even with these measures, we cannot guarantee the security of PII from “hackers” and others. By using our Website, you acknowledge and agree that we make no such guarantee, and that you use our Website at your own risk.
Publicly Displayed Information is Public If you use the Blog or any bulletin board or chat room on our web site you should be aware that any information you share is visible to other users. Personally identifiable information you submit to one of these forums can be read, collected, or used by other individuals to send you unsolicited messages. Tumbleweed is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. For example, if you choose to make information, which was previously nonpublic, available by enabling certain user features, Tumbleweed will collect that information from your interaction and the information will become publicly available.
Amendment of This Privacy Policy We may change and/or update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a new version on this page or on a successor page. We may at our discretion send an email alert of any changes. The new version will become effective on the date it’s posted, which will be listed at the top of the page as the new Effective Date
Integrity of Your Personal Information Tumbleweed has safeguards in place to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date for the purposes for which it is used.

[web site address]. In addition, you can request a copy of your personal information, your product registration history, and your interactions with our sales and support agents by contacting us at the email address below.
Privacy of Children Protecting children’s privacy is especially important to us. Tumbleweed recognizes that parents, guardians, or other adults often purchase our products for family use, including use by minors. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 for marketing purposes, but because some information is collected electronically, it can appear to be the personal information of Tumbleweed purchaser of the product, and will be treated as such by this privacy policy. If a child under 13 submits personal information to Tumbleweed and we learn that that personal information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. It is our policy to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all other applicable laws. Therefore we restrict purchases on our web site to persons 18 years or older.
International Users Tumbleweed abides by the safe harbor framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information collected from the European Union. We are not however, Certified by FTC or any other Data verification service.
