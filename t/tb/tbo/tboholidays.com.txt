Overview
This Privacy and Cookie Policy (the "Policy") becomes effective for all users from the date 26th May 2018.
We, Tek Travels DMCC. Operating through our flagship brand " TBO Holidays ", a corporation incorporated under the laws of the UAE as the data processor ( "TBO," "We," Or "us "),  explain in this Policy how we collect, process and/or use information that we receive via our websites, emails we send, and mobile applications (collectively, the "Platform") that link to this Policy, as amended from time to time. This Policy describes how TBO collects, processes, uses, shares and secures the personal information you provide. It also describes your choices regarding use, access, and correction of your personal information. For purposes of this Policy, personal information shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
This Policy applies only to information we collect, process and use through the Platform. This Policy does not apply to information that we collect through other channels, such as information that we collect offline, from other websites or from emails you send us.
Information We Collect
We collect information about you to provide our services. In order for us to best provide our services to you (and to help make it feasible for us to do so), it is essential that we are able to collect and use the information as described in this Policy. This means that the data collection is largely necessary for fulfilling the relationship we have with you, and where that is not the case, we have a legitimate interest in collecting the information described below.
Information You Give Us
When you fill out online forms, provide traveller or booking information, or provide us with other personal information actively, we collect that information for processing and use in accordance with this Policy. TBO may change its offerings, products and features from time to time, the options you have to provide us with personal information also may change, but here are few illustrations through which we collect personal information as provided by you:

Completing a form related to one of our products or services;
Uploading various documents required for identification;

Depending on how you interact with our Platform, the personal information we collect from you may vary. For example, to create an account we may ask only for an email address and password. In other circumstances, on signing up with us as an agent, we may ask you to provide other information, which may include your name, phone number, and/or postal address. We also collect and store certain information associated with actions you take. For example, when you perform a search on our site, we store such search information, information provided by you through online forms, IP addresses among others.

At your request, we will create your Profile with information we extract from details you have entered on the Platform. When you fill out and save your Profile, your saved Profile can be viewed only by authorized TBO employees.
If you enter credit card information on the Platform in connection with a booking, that information is sent directly from your browser to the third-party service provider we use to manage credit card processing and we do not store it on our servers. The service provider is not permitted to use the information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.
