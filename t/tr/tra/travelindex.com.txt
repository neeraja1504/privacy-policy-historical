At any time, you may choose to use, or not to use, this type of cookies technology to perform personalization on our site. If you choose not to, you must always manually log in to your profile each time you visit the site. Most website browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to display a warning before accepting a cookie, or to refuse all cookies.

Browser Level Information
One method of collecting aggregate information about your activities online (such as the pages you access most frequently or the search terms you enter), and information volunteered by you (such as survey or registration information), is by tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web. The computers that deliver the Web pages to you automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from one of our sites, our servers log your IP address. Travelindex sites record IP addresses for the purpose of system administration and to provide aggregate data to advertisers about the volume of use on our sites. We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our websites. In addition, your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.
Use of Information
Our primary goal in collecting user information is to enhance your experience on our website.
To Target Content
To develop content targeted to your interests, we use aggregated user information to determine which areas of our website users prefer based upon traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but instead how well each page or content area performs overall.
To Provide Interactive Communications
To enhance your experience we may provide you with interactive communications, such as electronic newsletters. Such interactive communications are provided only to those users who have expressly provided us with their permission to receive them as part of their user profile.
From time to time we may provide e-mails highlighting new features, promotions or contests on the website to those users who have expressly provided us with their permission to send such communications as part of their user profile.
To Provide Communications From Third Parties
We respect the privacy of our users and shall not disclose or distribute our user list to any third party, nor shall it permit anyone else to do so. However, we do make available for rental our list of those registrants who have expressly provided us with their permission to receive third party information and offers as part of their user profile. Your personal information is never transferred or disclosed to the third party.
Control of Information
Users may change their user profile to stop receiving newsletters or marketing material from Travelindex or on behalf of external third party business partners. Users may choose to stop receiving such communications at any time by visiting the "My profile" page at http://www.travelindex.com/myprofile
Providing Services to Users and Members We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of newsletter mailings, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. In some instances, one of these companies may collect information directly from you; in these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the external service provider and have the option to stop the transaction or process. In all cases, these companies are subject to agreements that require them to maintain the confidentiality of your information and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
Sale of Business or Bankruptcy
The ownership of Travelindex may change at some point in the future. Should that occur, we want this site to be able to maintain a relationship with you. In the event of a sale, merger, public offering, bankruptcy or other change in control of Travelindex your information may be shared with the person or business that owns or controls our websites. Opting out of receiving information from third parties will not affect our right to transfer your information to a new owner, but your choices will continue to be respected regarding the use of your information.
As Required By Law
Travelindex may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal process served on Travelindex or to protect and defend the rights or property of Travelindex.
Security
Your information is stored on Travelindex servers located in the United States. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption, firewalls and Secure Socket Layers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company.
Privacy of Children
No information is permitted to be either submitted to, or posted on our sites by users under the age of 13. Travelindex relies on our users to be truthful in responding to the question of age. Travelindex will not provide any personally identifying information about users under the age of 13, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever without first requesting parental permission. In the event that we learn we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as possible.
