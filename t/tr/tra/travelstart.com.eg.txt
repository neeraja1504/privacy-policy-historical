Cookies
Travelstart.com.eg uses cookies. A cookie is a piece of text stored on a user's computer by their web browser. Below we describe two types of cookies:
Session cookies : These are used to maintain something called session state and only last for the duration of users using the Website. A session cookie expires when a user closes his/her browser, or if a user has not visited the server for a certain period of time i.e. if you consider your journey through the site to be a conversation with us, this cookie reminds the site where we were in that conversation (for instance if at some point in the conversation you asked us to add a hotel to your basket, next time you click on the basket it will still be there). These are required for the site to function effectively but are not used in any way to identify you personally.
Permanent cookies: These cookies outlast user sessions and store a unique number on your hard drive in order to identify you as an individual user. No personal data is stored in these cookies. You can view these by looking in the cookies directory of your browser installation. We use these cookies to identify you between website visits. For example, if you were browsing Cairo hotels last time you were on the site and we have a great hotel deal, we may use this cookie to recognise you and show you this deal. These permanent cookies are not required for the site to work but may enhance your browsing experience. Although you cannot block 'session' cookies as they are required for our site to function correctly, your internet browser can be configured to reject 'permanent' cookies and is dependent on the type of internet browser you use. Please refer to the relevant internet browser manufacturer's website where you should be able to view the steps in rejecting these cookies if you wish to do so.
