NOTICE OF CHANGE:
From July 30th, 2015 forward, TrapCall will be cooperating with a third party team trying to identify and eliminate unwanted and potentially illegal robocalls. If this Research & Development (R&D) test is successful, we may in the future offer this service to our subscribers. During the test period, TrapCall will continue to send calls that you reject to your TrapCall voicemail. At the same time, the software installed on our server will be automatically analyzing voicemails to determine whether it is a human or robocall. The service relies on the analysis of the first few seconds of each voicemail to determine whether it is a human or robocall. Recordings of voicemails that are identified as robocalls will be used by the third party team to refine its algorithms and during part of the test period will be forwarded to another third party as part of the R&D effort. In the case of any voicemail that we determine to be left by a robocaller, just the audio recording and the caller ID of the robocaller will be shared with the third party for purposes of R&D. No other personally identifiable information will be shared. IF YOU USE TRAPCALL AFTER JULY 30TH YOU AGREE TO THIS CHANGE TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS CHANGE TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY, EMAIL US PRIOR TO JULY 30TH AT SUPPPORT@TRAPCALL.COM AND WE WILL MAKE SURE YOUR ACCOUNT IS NOT EFFECTED.
