Collection of Personally Identifiable Information
In order to use certain portions of the Service, you may be asked for, or you may choose to provide, certain personally identifiable information (PII) such as name, email address, postal address and similar information. We will not collect PII from you while you use the Service unless you voluntarily provide it to us or authorize us to collection such information.

"Cookies" are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by a web site for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with that web site. We may use cookies to customize your use of the Service and for other purposes to improve your use of the Service, and may also use web beacons, web bugs, action tags and third party cookies.

TravelByU may use or disclose PII to operate and manage the Service, to provide services that you have requested or respond to your other inquires or requests. We may also disclose PII in the establishment or exercise of legal rights or defense against legal claims, to comply with applicable laws or regulations, to comply with a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order or to investigate suspected fraud or a violation of the terms of the TravelByU User Agreement.
We will never sell your Personal Information to any third party not affiliated with TravelByU without your consent, except in connection with the sale or merger of TravelByU or the division responsible for such services.

Security
The security of your PII is very important to us and we take commercially reasonable steps to attempt to secure your PII. We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. Only those employees and contractors who need access to your PII in order to perform their duties are authorized to have access. However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and TravelByU or information stored or transmitted through the Service or on our servers, will be completely free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers, and your use of the Service demonstrates your assumption of this risk.
