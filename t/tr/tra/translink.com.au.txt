TransLink, a division of the Department of Transport and Main Roads is committed to protecting your privacy. TransLink abides by the Information Privacy Act 2009 (IP Act) which regulates the way in which Queensland government agencies must manage personal information. It addresses concerns about any unauthorised use of this information and gives individuals a right of access to personal information held about them.

You must not provide to any person or invite or solicit any third party to provide you with, passwords or other information to enable such access.
Email and SMS
We will not use your personal contact details you provide such as email address, SMS device number or phone number other than for the purpose for which you provided it.

Mobile applications
To help improve the app and TransLink services more generally, TransLink may, from time-to-time, record information about your use of the app. This information may include:

when and how the app is used
the pages accessed and the types of functions used
your location when using a map, stop alarm or 'stops near you' feature, and

TransLink (and its contractors) may use the information recorded about your use of the app to contact you and invite you to participate in surveys and to otherwise improve the app and TransLink services more generally.
By downloading the TransLink app and 'enabling' each push notification function in the app settings on your device, you consent to TransLink delivering push notifications to your device to:
notify you of current or upcoming journey or route disruptions; and
invite you to participate in TransLink customer surveys.
If you do not wish to receive either or both types of push notifications from TransLink, you may disable either or both types of push notification functions in the app settings on your device.
Unless otherwise stated in these conditions of use, no attempt will be made to identify users or users' activities, unless TransLink is required by law to do so.
