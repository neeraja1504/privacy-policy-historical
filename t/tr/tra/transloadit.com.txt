Privacy policy | Transloadit
In order to provide this service, we capture and store information about you and about users uploading material to the service:
As of 25 May 2018, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has come into force. We wrote this post to outline what Transloadit - and our customers - can do to make sure the new rules are being followed.
Who is responsible for data protection?
Since we are operating with a staff of less than ten people, we do not have an external data officer. Responsible for data protection are our founders Tim Koschützki and Kevin van Zonneveld. You can reach them at founders@transloadit.com.
What data is collected?
Transloadit collects and shares information about its customers. Since Transloadit is a B2B service, this concerns data on businesses. We also receive a limited amount of data on our customers' customers. These are the individuals or 'data subjects' that the GDPR specifically aims to protect, and they come in contact with Transloadit when we handle their uploads or when they request the status of encoding progress of their files.
As far as these cases are concerned, Transloadit receives the following data on end-users:
From the website
IP addresses
Request headers
Data entered on our website
The browser session (identified through a cookie)
Information used to analyze usage of our platform (through cookies from Google Analytics. More on cookies is explained below)
From the API
IP addresses
Request headers
Your user agent (browser, device, etc.)
Data submitted to our API (media files, uploads)
All data stored by us is only used for internal processing, and never sold or otherwise given away.
Since Transloadit does not store data on data subjects, migration or deletion tools are not applicable.
What data is stored exactly?
Transloadit only stores links to uploaded media files in the status JSON of an Assembly. We do not store any other data coming from data subjects.
Transloadit only stores temporary files, and we do so for 24 hours. Files are hashed and anonymized.
Transloadit employees only look at your files to troubleshoot problems. This rarely happens, and when it does, we do so with the understanding that anything we see is to be kept strictly confidential.
Any Transloadit employee or subcontractor with access to these systems will have signed an NDA, which among other things, includes enforcing two-factor authentication for critical services, encrypted drives, and password managers.
If it is important to you that the media files of your end-users, kept during the 24-hour window, temporarily resides in a particular region, Transloadit currently operates in two regions: us-east-1 (Virginia, USA) and eu-west-1 (Ireland). By default, Transloadit will serve your users from the region closest to them, but you can also opt to exclusively address one region, by using an endpoint like https://api2-eu-west-1.transloadit.com/.
Storing Assemblies
Assemblies contain links to the media files that have been uploaded by data subjects. If the links point to files temporarily hosted by us, then these links will expire after 24 hours (at the point when the associated files are discarded). Links to files that were exported to your own storage system (Amazon S3, FTP server, Rackspace container, etc.) will expire based on the expiry policy you set forth on these containers.
Assemblies will be archived after three months following their creation. Any Assembly Status JSON will cease to be available through https://api2.transloadit.com/assemblies/[[assembly_id]] after three months, along with all links to media files uploaded for this Assembly. Assembly IDs are secure: only the data subject, you as our customer and Transloadit staff know these Assembly IDs.
