Profiling, segmentation and automated decision making:
We have a very wide range of customers across the world and we try to personalise the experience for them. Profiling ranges from sending marketing communication in preferred language, to new product announcements which might be useful for particular customers or providing special offers. None of our profiling activities cause legal effects for the customer, except for fraud prevention measures which we have a legal responsibility to as per Anti-Money Laundering legislation.
We always ask our customers for privacy policy consent:
1) If customer declines the privacy policy - we include only 1st and 2nd types of data (personal data + technical/behavioral/communication data), leaving 3rd type of marketing data not used. By choosing this option we'll still track data which is needed for us to make our service available to you, but this data will not be used for marketing purposes. We will not send any marketing communication messages, including special offers, unless customer chooses to receive them with separate consent.
2) If customer accepts the privacy policy - we include 1st, 2nd and 3rd types of data. In some behavioral analytics tool we will send additional identifiers to better understand customer behavior. We’ll also send marketing communication messages using electronic channels.
You can always change your tracking and communication preferences in your settings menu. If you wish to downgrade your tracking level, keep in mind that existing data will still be available until data retention period is over. If you wish your data to be deleted sooner, please express this request via email privacy@transfergo.com.
If the customer wants to reset tracking option in logged out system, the best way to do it is clear browsing cache.
Marketing communication preferences:
We communicate with our customers about new products or services, special offers and other marketing announcements. By accepting this privacy policy you agree to receive marketing communication from us using electronic methods (e-mail, app, SMS, phone calls). If you decline this privacy policy, we'll not send you any marketing communication and you'll miss the special offers which we give to our customers. Remember, you can always change this preference in your profile settings and configure specific channels you wish to receive the communication through.
Transactional information, e.g. information about received money, document requests and/or other information related to our main service is not part of marketing communication and cannot be disabled.
Executing your rights to data:
European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives you more rights to control which data about you can be accessed by companies like us. Here’s a list of rights specified in regulation:
The data subject’s right of access.
The data subject’s right to rectification.
The data subject right to restriction of processing.
The right to be informed.
The right to data portability.
The right to object data processing.
To execute your GDPR rights please contact us via email privacy@transfergo.com. Please use the email you used to register in TransferGo, as we will have to perform a customer identification process. We'll respond within 30 calendar days to your request. Please keep in mind that as a regulated business TransferGo has to retain customers’ personal data as well as additional documents for the purpose of preventing, detecting and investigating by the competent authorities, possible money laundering or terrorist financing. To comply with AML/CTF regulatory requirements, a copy of the documents and customer’s personal information will be stored in our system for a period of five (5) years after the end of the business relationship with the customer or after the date of an occasional transaction. Please be aware that AML/CTF regulatory requirements overrule the GDPR requirements. In some cases where we do not have reliable methods to remove your data, it will be automatically cleared within 6 months after data retention period expires.
If a customer request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve the right to refuse to act on the request or impose an administrative fee.
