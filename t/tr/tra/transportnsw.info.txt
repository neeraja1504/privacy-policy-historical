Cookies
We collect the information on our Site by using ‘cookies’ which are small pieces of text data that a web server can store on, and later retrieve from, a computer. They do not personally identify you, but do identify your browser. Cookies can be either 'persistent' or 'session' based. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer, contain an expiration date, and may be used to track your browsing behaviour upon return to the issuing website. Session cookies are short-lived, are used only during a browsing session, and expire when you shut down your browser.
We use first and second party persistent cookies (i.e. issued and retrieved by the transportnsw.info systems or its service providers) to collect information about visitor behaviour and general website statistics. We may also use services, for example, Facebook Pixel and Cadreon, which may place cookies on your browser to provide relevant advertisements and information from us to your browser or app.

Transport for NSW (TfNSW) is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information in accordance with the Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 (NSW) (PPIP Act).
Consent
By participating in the On Demand Travel Credit Trial ( ODTC Trial ) you consent to TfNSW collecting, using, storing and disclosing your personal information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Notice.
The provision of your personal information is voluntary, but you may not be able to participate in the ODTC Trial if you do not provide the personal information required in order for TfNSW to link your trips.
Collection
TfNSW will collect your name, email address, mobile telephone number and Opal card number directly from you when you register to participate in the ODTC Trial.
TfNSW will also collect personal information about you from the On Demand service(such as trip information including the date, time and location of your On Demand trip, the cost of your On Demand ticket and ticket type (for example, adult or concession) and specific customer reference numbers designated to your On Demand account).
You will also enter the details of a payment card directly into a Mastercard Payment Gateway Services ( MPGS ) hosted web-form situated on the TfNSW On Demand webpage. This is required to facilitate payment of On Demand trips. Importantly, TfNSW does not collect any payment card details. Although the web-form is situated on the TfNSW On Demand webpage, TfNSW does not have access to the information that is entered into the MPGS. This is collected and held by Mastercard. Instead, the MPGS provides TfNSW with a unique 64 character payment token associated with the particular payment method for your account. TfNSW only collects the payment token returned by MPGS.
Your personal information will be collected to assist TfNSW with:
Administering the ODTC Trial including the provision of any travel credits.
Transport planning and policy
Transport information
Use
The ODTC Trial requires a customer to register a new account with TfNSW for Opal Connect ( Opal Connect Account ). Certain personal information about you (set out above under Collection ) will be used to link your Opal card and your On Demand booking account number. Once linked, TfNSW will consolidate your On Demand and Opal trips and calculate travel credits for the intermodal transfers between On Demand and Opal trips. You can view your consolidated travel history for On Demand trips and connected Opal trips, by logging in to your Opal Connect account and viewing your activity.
When you book a trip with On Demand to travel and pay for this trip using the stored payment method in your Opal Connect Account, this trip will be registered with On Demand in accordance with the Terms and Conditions (pdf 159KB). When you board the On Demand bus service, TfNSW will be notified of this trip by an exchange of the information above.
Once you tap on or off at an Opal network service, your information in relation to tapping on or off the Opal network and the On Demand bus trip you took will be linked in your Opal Connect Account held by TfNSW.
TfNSW will verify that you have travelled on the On Demand bus service and the Opal network within 60 minutes. At that time, you will be eligible to receive a credit of $2.00 if you are an Adult Opal Customer or $1.00 if you are an Opal Concession Card Customer.
Travel credits will be paid into your Opal account, rather than refunded back to your credit or debit card.
Disclosure
TfNSW will exchange your personal information with the On Demand service to verify your connecting trips between Interline On Demand and the Opal network (set out above under Use ).
Only those who have registered for the ODTC Trial on the TfNSW website will have their information shared between TfNSW and Interline On Demand.
TfNSW will not use or disclose your personal information for any purpose other than those set out in this Privacy Notice. TfNSW will not disclose your personal information, unless you consent, or TfNSW is required to by law.
Contact us
TfNSW will ensure the confidentiality and security of your information.

Due to the developing nature of privacy principles for online communication, this Privacy statement may be modified or expanded in light of new developments or issues that may arise from time to time. The amended Privacy Statement will be posted to the Site and will operate from the time it is posted.
