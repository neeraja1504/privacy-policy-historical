Transferr recommends that users create usernames that are not entirely descriptive, i.e. if your name is 'John Smith' we don't recommend a username like 'johnsmith', as this could lead to others inferring that your name is 'John Smith'. Please choose passwords carefully. For maximum security, numbers, letters and punctuation marks are recommended to be used. Do not use the name of pets, loved ones or anything easily guessable. Transferr takes your Privacy and Identity Theft seriously, if you are concerned that someone has discovered your password, ensure you change it, or close your account with us.
