Personal data
Personal data means information by which a person may be identified, i.e., data that can be matched to an individual. This includes names, email addresses or telephone numbers, but also data concerning preferences, hobbies, memberships or previously visited websites.
Only data that are anonymous, i.e. are stored without reference to a specific individual (for instance the number of visits to a particular website), do not qualify as personal data. If there is a legitimate cause for concern, please contact the party responsible for the site immediately in writing. Where any infringement of rights is detected, the content in question will be removed from the site without delay.
Collection of access data
The host of this offer collects data on each single access to the offer. Such data are stored anonymously, without reference to specific individuals. Access data includes:
• the name of the visited website,
• the file, date and time of the visit,
• the data load that was transferred,
• a download report,
• the browser used, including its version,
• the user’s operating system,
• the referrer URL (the previously visited site) and the referring provider (such as T-Online),
• and the data requested from the host’s server.
The host will use the log file data without identification of the user, exclusively for purposes of statistical analyses for operating and optimizing the offer. However, the host reserves the right to subsequently check the log file data if there is concrete, legitimate evidence to suspect unlawful use.
Collection and use of personal data
Personal data will be collected and used by the host only as permitted by law or authorized by the user. A user using the service normally will be aware of the data that are stored, for example the name, email address and message when using a contact or comment form.
Contact
When users initiate contact with the Operator (e.g. via e-mail or via a contact form), the user’s data will be stored for the purpose of handling the inquiry and in the event that questions arise later. The data will never be forwarded to any third party. Neither will the data be matched with other data that might have been acquired via other components of our website.
Warnings, data integrity
The host has taken organizational, contractual and technical safety precautions to ensure compliance with the applicable data protection laws. However, users should be aware that the access to publicly available data cannot be fully controlled. Sensitive information, such as intimate details, illnesses, religious views or similar should therefore not be published at all. Users who nevertheless decide to publish such details should be aware that their disclosure on the internet often is irreversible.
Data transfer to third parties
User data will be transferred to third parties only as permitted by law or authorized by the user. Without the user’s consent, the personal data of a user will under no circumstances be sold or transferred to any third party for purposes of advertising or setting up of user profiles.
Data transfer to third parties abroad
Any transfer of data to third parties abroad will be strictly subject to the applicable laws. Data will be transferred to non-Member States of the European Union or to other contracting states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area only if such countries offer an adequate level of protection within the meaning of the German Data Protection Act. Third parties based in the USA will be assumed to offer an adequate level of protection if they have agreed to comply with the Safe Harbour agreement (such as Google).
Cookies
The host uses cookies in connection with the offer. Cookies are small files that are stored on the user’s computer and save information for the host. Temporary cookies will be deleted after the browser is closed, while permanent cookies are maintained for a predefined period of time and provide the stored information when the user revisits the offer.

Such cookies are provided by the host or by third parties (such as advertising partners).
Users may at any time object to any such use of their data by notice to the contact details set out at the end of this privacy policy. If the host cannot be reasonably expected, for technical or economic reasons, to suspend any such data processing for individual users, the host may terminate the user relationship with the user.
Users are able to control the use of cookies. Most browsers offer an option to restrict or fully refuse any storing of cookies. The host seeks to arrange the offer so that no cookies are necessary. Users are advised, however, that the use and in particular user friendliness may be impaired if no cookies are accepted.
