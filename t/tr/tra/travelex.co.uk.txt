We collect your information when you interact with us for the provision of Travelex services or through interaction with our sites or promotions. The information we collect is either information you give to us, information we collect automatically, information we receive from third-parties or information you provide about other people.
We collect and process your information in the following ways:
Information you give us:
You give us information about yourself when you purchase or use Travelex Services, or communicate with us (whether in writing, by phone or by any other means), or enter into any of our competitions, promotions or surveys.

This is generally to provide you with the services that you request from us, to keep you informed and to improve your customer experience and the quality of the Travelex Services.

Security
The internet is a global environment, so using the internet to collect and process your information necessarily involves transmitting data internationally. Therefore, by browsing our sites and communicating electronically with us, you acknowledge our processing of your information in this way. However, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that all information collected through our sites is treated securely and in accordance with this Notice and strict data protection standards.
In providing our services to you, such as fulfilling orders and taking payments, we may transfer the data we collect from you and about you to destinations outside of the European Economic Area ('EEA'), within the Travelex Group of companies, with our third party processors, or with our partners. This is because the information is processed in those other locations. Where we do so, we ensure that security measures and appropriate safeguards are put in place to protect your information and ensure that all transfers of your information comply with applicable data protection law. We also ensure that processing is only ever carried out in accordance with our instructions.
In all cases where we transfer information across borders, we rely on acceptable and defined legal mechanisms to ensure that we protect data at all times. We may use Standard Contractual Clauses that have been provided by the EU Commission, other agreements and 'adequacy' protections that have been defined and approved by the European Commission or the relevant supervisory authority. For transfers between Travelex Group companies, we have in place an intra group transfer agreement, incorporating Standard Contractual Clauses. Or we may use new standards as these are developed by the appropriate regulatory authorities.
International transfers
In providing the Travelex services to you we sometimes transfer your information to other countries. Where we transfer your information outside the European Union or EEA (i.e. countries that are members of the EU together with Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein) we ensure that all data is treated with the same security measures regardless of location, and in accordance with our standards, policies, regulatory and legal obligations.
