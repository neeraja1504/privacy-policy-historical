5. Interest-Based Advertising
We may use your Personal Data to help us decide which products, services and offers may be of interest to you.
We use third party analytics and social media providers to collect information about your use of the Site, see the overall patterns of usage on the Site, deliver advertisements to your social media account based on email addresses, optimize ad performance, and to determine whether our advertising is effective.  We use analytics tools and other third party technologies, including cookies, to collect Personal Information and Non-Personal Information in the form of various usage and user metrics when you use our Site.  These tools and technologies collect and analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses, device and software identifiers, referring and exit URLs, onsite behavior and usage information, feature use metrics and statistics, usage and purchase history, MAC Address, mobile unique device ID, and other similar information.
The third party analytics companies (like Google and IBM) who collect information on our Site and other online products and/or sites may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products relating to your activities across their network of websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.
In addition to our use of technologies as described herein, we may permit certain third party companies, including online ad networks such as Google and Conversant, to help us tailor advertising that we think may be of interest to you based on your use of our Services and to otherwise collect and use data about your use of our Services. These networks track your online activities over time and across third party websites and online services by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of the technologies described in the “Information We Collect When You Use the Site” Section above, and they use this information to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests.  This collection and ad targeting takes place both on our Site and on third-party websites that participate in the ad network. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
Opting out of analytics:   You may opt out of Google Analytics by visiting the Google Analytics opt-out page https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.  Google has additional information available about their Remarketing Privacy Guidelines, and Restrictions.  You may learn more at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
Opting out of Conversant: You may opt out of Conversant by clicking here.
You may view a list of other third party service providers who collect information, and/or opt-out of such collection of information about you, by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ or http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.
Please note that opting out of receiving targeted ads will not prevent you from being served advertisements generally; rather, opting out means that the online ads presented will not be based on your particular interests.
We currently do not respond to Do Not Track Signals.   Some third parties, such as companies that offer Internet browsers, have developed signals (e.g., browser do not track signals) that give you a choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms offered by Internet browsers. If you would like more information on self-regulatory programs that permit you to exercise choice, click on the ad networks link in the paragraph above.
6. Third Party Links and Data.
The Site may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third parties may collect Usage Information and your Device Identifier when pages from the Site are served to you. In addition, Tractor Supply's Site may include links to services that are operated and controlled by third parties. Examples include:
the Replacement Parts Portal;
the Tractor Supply Credit Card;
the Power Plus Protection Plan;
We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by any of these third parties. For example, if you “click” on a link, the “click” may take you off the Site onto a different site. These other sites may independently collect data about you and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.
The inclusion of any link does not imply Tractor Supply's endorsement of any other company, its websites, or its products and/or services. We have no control over such websites and therefore have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organizations that operate such linked websites may collect, use or disclose and otherwise treat your personal information.
Third party Service Providers may need access to some of your personal information. In such cases, we only provide third party agents with the minimum amount of information needed to complete the requested service or transaction. We may also provide your information to our affiliated companies and successors. We reserve the right to provide third parties with aggregate statistics about our clients, traffic patterns and related site information. This data reflects site usage patterns, but does not contain personally identifiable information about any individual user.
