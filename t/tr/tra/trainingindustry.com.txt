Optional Voluntary Information
Training Industry, Inc. offers a variety of information and resources to our customers and site visitors, many of which require the voluntary submission of personal information:
Newsletters, Alerts and Publications
We offer free electronic newsletters and publications to users. Training Industry, Inc. gathers the email addresses of all users who voluntarily subscribe and provides options in every message we send to change individual subscription preferences and/or to unsubscribe from any further communications. Subscribers may indicate the topics about which they prefer to receive communications and the types of communications they prefer to receive. Because our objective is to provide each individual with information that is most relevant to his or her individual interests, topic interests may be adjusted based on content engagement. Users can also select their subscription preferences to influence which newsletters, bulletins and publications they receive as part of their free subscription, and they may change these preferences at any time using the links provided in email communications and on the website. Ultimately, users have full control over whether to subscribe to Training Industry email communications and may unsubscribe at any time using the links provided in every Training Industry email.
Surveys
Training Industry, Inc. may invite our subscribers to participate in surveys. The aggregated information collected in these research surveys may be published and/or shared with sponsoring companies, but Training Industry will never share personally identifiable information or information about specific individuals with any third party.

USE OF INFORMATION
Training Industry, Inc. uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience on our sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on their interests.
As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send electronic newsletters and publications and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys, forums and events. We send newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter) and occasionally send special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something.
We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don’t like, based on traffic to those areas. This helps us continue to build a better service for our audience. We track search terms entered in the search function as one of many measures of what interests our users.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when users visit our website. These companies may use information (not including individuals’ name, address, email address or telephone number) about their visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to them. More information about this practice and users’ choices about not having this information used by these companies is located here.
Training Industry, Inc. creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. These reports allow our advertisers to advertise more effectively and allow our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don’t track the usage patterns of individual users for advertisers, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked its ad, unless that user specifically shares his or her contact information with that advertiser. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.
SHARING OF THE INFORMATION
Training Industry, Inc. uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit users’ needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience’s demographics. This process is essential to keeping our service free.
