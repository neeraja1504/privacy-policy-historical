Privacy Policy at Tradesparq
Tradesparq is committed to privacy protection. By registering for our service, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy.
By submitting personal information to Tradesparq, you expressly consent to the processing of your personal information according to this Privacy Policy.
1.Notification of Changes
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as the Tradesparq changes and expands. If we update this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated Policy on this page. Unless otherwise provided below, the revised terms will take effect when they are posted. Once any changes that we make to this Privacy Policy become effective, your continued use of Tradesparq after such time will signify your acceptance of the new terms. If we are going to use your Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below) in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that affect User information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying Users of the change. In some cases when we post the notice we may also email Users who have not opted out of receiving communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
2.Tradesparq Links to Other Sites
Tradesparq is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other web sites to which the site links or which link to the site. By clicking on a link, logo or other item, please note that you may no longer be on the Tradesparq website. To check what Internet location you are on, note the URL at the top and/or bottom of your browser. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement of that web site whenever interacting with any site.
3.Information We Gather During Registration
If you register to use Tradesparq we collect and store information that specifically identifies you or your account ("Personally Identifiable Information"). At this time, the most information you would be required to submit is information about whether you are a "buyer", "seller", or "service provider", your name, password, and email address. Persons wishing to pay for banner advertisements or preferred search listings are also required to enter a valid credit card number and name as it appears on the credit card or other information such as bank routing and account numbers to facilitate ACH payments. We may, in the future, include other optional requests for information from you, to help us to tailor the site for you and deliver personalized information to you. We may supplement our information with additional information purchased from third parties for marketing purposes. Credit card information and any bank information will be transmitted via SSL encryption for your protection.
4.Tradesparq Profiles, Connections, Groups, Events, etc.
These areas of the site are for the benefit of Users. The private and shared areas of the site help to facilitate communication and the exchange and sharing of information between Users. Tradesparq may use non-Personally Identifiable Information from these and other areas of the site for statistical analysis, product development, marketing, and research. Tradesparq reserves the right to monitor communications throughout our site, and if we believe that a User is violating our User Agreement or any of our Policies; international, federal or state laws; and/or our stated policies, we may terminate such usage.
5.Online Surveys and Contests
Periodically, Tradesparq conducts online User surveys to collect information about our Users, their preferences and work habits. These surveys are optional and if you choose to respond, your responses will be kept anonymous. Similarly, we may offer contests to qualifying Users in which we ask for contact and demographic information such as name, email address and mailing address. None of this information is shared with third parties, except in summary form, if at all. The demographic information that Tradesparq collects in the registration process and through online surveys is used to help us improve the Tradesparq site to meet the needs and preferences of our Users. This may include targeting advertising or other information to you about our offerings. Information we gather through a contest may also be disclosed to third parties as necessary for prize fulfillment and other aspects of any contest or similar offering.
6.The Payment System
Tradesparq offers a payment system via a licensed third-party payment gateway (Payment Asia) that allows Users to pay for banner advertising and preferred search result listings with a credit card, debit card or via Alipay. If you make use of this service, the payment system will collect your credit card number and/or other entered financial institution information and will use that information to bill you any fees and/or to perform the billing operation on behalf of the Provider, including but not limited to the use and disclosure of such credit card number and information to third parties as necessary to complete such billing operation.
7.Automatically Gathered Information
Tradesparq automatically collects your browser type and browser software version to tailor the presentation of the Tradesparq site to your platform and to maintain a record of your activity on the site. Tradesparq uses cookies to enable Users to specify unique preferences and to track User trends and patterns. Users always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. If you disable cookies on your browser, please note that some parts of our site may not function as effectively or may be considerably slower. As an automatic process, our web server software records a log file of IP addresses that access the Tradesparq site. We also collect IP address information but do not ordinarily link IP addresses to Users' Personally Identifiable Information, other than for statistical analysis as needed. However, we can and will use IP addresses to identify a User when we, in our sole discretion, determine that it is necessary to enforce compliance with our various policies or to protect our service, site, customers or others.
8.Email Referral Feature
Tradesparq offers the ability to send friends or colleagues emails about product or service information available through Tradesparq. If you choose to use this feature, be assured that Tradesparq only uses these email addresses on a one-time basis to send the requested posting and we use your email address to copy you on the message or to send on your behalf.

After registering on Tradesparq you may set up your profile describing your company, services, products and specifications, and qualifications as a Seller or Service Provider, or your company and related information for you, as a Buyer. We strongly encourage you to complete your profile as much as possible as this may directly affect your likelihood of finding worthwhile opportunities or, as a Buyer, outstanding Seller or Service Provider candidates.

However, these third-party partners may not use this Personally Identifiable Information for any reason other than to provide the service or product that the User has explicitly signed up for. While it is Tradesparq's general policy not to share anything other than summarized or aggregated data with the partner, any Personally Identifiable Information you provide may also be received by the co-branded site and could be stored and used by the co-branded service or product Provider according to their privacy policy. Please take the time to review these third-party privacy policies.
14.Third Party Intermediaries
