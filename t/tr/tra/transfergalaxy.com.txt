The same applies in relation to competitions and campaigns, we will process the personal data of the participants and the winners to fulfil our part of the contract.
As long as you are a customer we believe that it is in your interest to receive occasional information about the Service and we may therefore send you marketing notices, service updates, and promotional offers that we believe are relevant for you based on your previous use of the Service. For the same reason, we may also process your data to analyse our business operations in order to improve the Service.
In situations where you give us specific consent to process certain kinds of personal data, you are able to withdraw that consent at any time. We will then stop processing such data and, if no other legal ground for keeping your personal data apply, we will also erase your data from our system.

Please note that we may retain any personal data mentioned above for a longer period than stated above, if required by law or if required to protect the rights, property or safety of TransferGalaxy or of the Service provided by us or our partners.
6.      HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH OTHERS
We may share your personal data with:
Third-party service providers under contract with TransferGalaxy that help us with our business operations, such as transaction processing, fraud prevention, email communications, customer support and marketing.

7.      TRANSFERRING DATA OUTSIDE OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA
Personal data which is submitted via our Service is sent to and stored on secure servers owned by, or operated for, us in the European Economic Area ("EEA"). Such data may be transferred to, or stored at, a destination outside the EEA and may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our service providers. Such transfers may be made in order to operate the Service, improve our Service, or to assist in our security or fraud protection activities.
Where recipients are outside the EEA, we will ensure that they provide an adequate level of protection for your personal data or that the transfer is otherwise permitted under applicable data protection legislation e.g. by using standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, by relying on a relevant adequacy decision by the European Commission, or on other legal grounds in accordance with applicable law.

The General Data Protection Regulation establishes certain rights in relation to your personal data, which are listed below:

At any time, you are welcome to contact us in relation to these rights. However, please note that there are certain exceptions where these rights may be superseded by laws and other requirements applicable to regulated financial institutions like TransferGalaxy.

When you enter financial information (such as credit/debit card and banking information) within our Service, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
