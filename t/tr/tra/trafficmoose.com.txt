On this day 2018-05-24, the following policy has been drawn up for Artillery Marketing Group AB.
Purpose
We take care of your privacy. You should be able to feel secure when entrusting your personal data to us. For this reason, we have drawn up this policy. It is based on current data protection legislation and clarifies how we work to safeguard your rights and privacy.
The purpose of this policy is to make you aware of how we process your personal data, what we use them for, who may view them and under what conditions, and how you can safeguard your rights.
Background
The main reason why we process your personal data is to fulfil our obligations towards you. We proceed on the basis that we do not process more personal data that is necessary for the purpose, and always endeavour to use the least sensitive information.
We also need your personal data to provide you with a good service, for example, in terms of marketing, monitoring and information. In addition, we may need your personal data to comply with laws and carry out customer and market analyses.
You have the right to object to our use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. When we collect personal data about you for the first time, you will receive more information on this and how you can object to it.

You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. In such case, we will no longer process your personal data or obtain new data, provided that this is not necessary for the fulfilment of our obligations in accordance with an agreement or the law.
