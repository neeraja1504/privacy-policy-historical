Like many websites, we use automated programs, including Google Analytics. Such programs use cookies to collect and analyze data. The data collected includes IP addresses, ISPs, types of browser, referring and exit pages, broad geographical user locations, and the quantity of user clicks. User movements within the site are tracked by IP addresses in order to determine pages that are being visited, including factors such as the duration of visits.

Cookies and Web Beacons
While the TransitionsAbroad.com website does not currently collect cookies for its own usage, affiliates on TransitionsAbroad.com, including Google Adsense, do make use of cookies.
A cookie is a small piece of text data that is transmitted from a website and then stored in a web browser while the user is in the process of browsing. Whenever a user loads a website that transmits cookies, the user's browser will return the cookie to the server hosting the website in order to allow it to know about the user's actions.
You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in security programs such as your security software. Turning off cookies, however, can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as forums or other accounts. Deleting cookies also does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have changed your browser settings to permanently disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running advertisements, a new cookie will be generated.
