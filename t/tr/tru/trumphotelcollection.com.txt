**1.Introduction. **
Trump is committed to providing you with the best products and services possible. Transparency over how we collect, safeguard and use your information is of paramount importance to us. Trump has developed this Privacy & Cookie Policy to give you a clear understanding of our privacy practices, including how we process (e.g., collect, use and store) your personal data, for what purposes we may share such information, and your rights and choices with regard to controlling your personal data. Please review our Terms of Service which governs your use of the Services. Any capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy & Cookie Policy shall have the meaning ascribed in the Terms of Service.
This Privacy & Cookie Policy only applies to the information processed by The Trump Organization and its affiliates (collectively, “Trump”, “we”, “our” or “us”) or any third parties acting with our authorization or otherwise provided to us by third parties about you, in each instance, in connection with your (a) interaction with our properties, including our hotels, golf courses, clubs, spas, realty offices, brokerage, retail establishments and managed properties, (b) use of websites owned and controlled by Trump (collectively, “Sites”), (c) use of our mobile, web, tablet, desktop and other applications, including applications made available through Facebook, iOS and Android (the “App(s)”), and (d) use of any other content, applications, features, functionality, information and services offered by us, whether through our Apps, the Sites, at our properties or otherwise (each of the above individually and collectively referred to herein as the “Services”).
Please note that when you visit a website operated by any of our third-party licensees, such as, for example, developers or owners of Trump branded properties, Trump does not control such websites and is therefore is not responsible for their privacy practices, even though our branding may appear on those sites. This means that the collection, storage, use and sharing of your information with respect to those websites will also be governed by the applicable privacy policies of those third parties. We encourage you to check the applicable privacy policy of such third party to determine, among other things, how they will handle any personal information or other information that they may collect from you.
This Privacy & Cookie Policy applies regardless of the Device you use to access the Services and whether you are accessing or using the Services in-person, as a registered user or otherwise. The collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy & Cookie Policy is based on our contractual obligations to you, our legitimate business interest, compliance with our legal or regulatory obligations or, where applicable, your voluntary consent. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy & Cookie Policy, then you have the choice not to utilize the Services.
