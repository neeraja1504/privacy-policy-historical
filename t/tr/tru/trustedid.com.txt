We adopt the following general steps that we take to protect your personal information:
We adopt the following general steps that we take to protect your personal information: Any sensitive personally identifiable information entered into our website, such as your social security number or credit card number, is transferred in an encrypted format using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or another equivalent technology. (To learn more about SSL, follow this link). TrustedID employees with access to your personal information undergo thorough background checks. We provide multiple layers of protection against network or physical intrusion. We monitor our servers and physical location for unauthorized access. You will notice when you are on our website that some familiar indicators appear in your browser to confirm the entire page is secure. These indicators include the small "lock" icon and the "s" in the Web address bar (for example, "https").
2. Collecting information
We collect the information necessary to deliver the products you request.
The information we gather from you enables us to personalize and improve our products and website features. We collect the following types of information from you.
Personal Information You Provide to Us:
We may receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then we may not be able to offer you our products, or you may not be able to take advantage of all of the features of our products. The Personal Information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products. The Personal Information that you provide to us to use our products will be used for the purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy and the terms and conditions for the associated product, if applicable.
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide our products. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you our products, contact us at help@trustedid.com. We will also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Information Collected Automatically:
We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our website.
Cookies: Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we may transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages on our website are visited and by how many people. TrustedID cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie. The use of cookies by our partners, or affiliates, is not governed by this Privacy Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.
Web Beacons: We use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our website by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.
We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please contact us at help@trustedid.com.
Log Files: TrustedID may choose to automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, computer MAC address, TrustedID cookie information, and the page you requested. Our servers may automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our website and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. TrustedID uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the website so that we can make the website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those features.
E-mail Communications: TrustedID does not send any solicitations to you via email, without your express consent. We do not ask you to email us personal information. We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from TrustedID if your computer supports this type of program. TrustedID may use this confirmation to help ensure the timeliness and effectiveness of correspondence. We will send you product-related announcements periodically. For instance, if our website is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we may send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.
Registration: In order to access some portions of this website, you must first complete the registration form submitting your email address and creating a password. During registration you are required to provide your personal information including: name, mailing address, Date of Birth, Phone numbers, gender, Social Security Number and email address. We use this information to verify your identity as well as uniquely identify your information with credit bureaus and other data stores. You will receive email during the registration process detailing steps you will need to follow for completion as well as important information you will want to retain for your records
Public Forums: Our website offers publicly accessible blogs. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at help@trustedid.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case, we will let you know that we are unable to do so and why.
Orders: If you purchase a product from us on our website order form, we request certain personal information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).
We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.
Social Security Numbers: We require your social security number to enhance the protection offered by TrustedID. When you enter your social security number during our registration process, we encrypt it using secure socket layer technology (SSL) or other equivalent technology.
Supplementation of Personal Information: To improve the security of our website, to protect your identity, and protect your information, we may verify your personal information by matching the information you provide to TrustedID against other publicly available information that we obtain from identification verification companies. This matching is done with security in mind and all your information, both that which you provide to TrustedID and that which we obtain through third parties, is held in confidence.
3. Information Sharing
We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone without your express consent. We share personal information only with our business partners, affiliates and agents as described in this Privacy Policy.
Business Partners: We work closely with a variety of business partners and affiliates. In certain situations, these businesses may operate at the TrustedID website or offer products to you through TrustedID's website.

We may share information that is related to such transactions with that business partner, such as information regarding whether your registration is completed, or whether you are an active user of product. In the event you are the user of a product purchased for you by a third party, (e.g., your employer), TrustedID may share information with the third party, such as your name, address, date of registration and type of membership.
Agents: We may employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf such as an email provider to send specific types of email, or payment processor to process your credit card and need to share information (Name, Address, Phone Number) with them to provide products to you. Unless we tell you differently, TrustedID 's agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of TrustedID may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. You will be notified via a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
Protection of TrustedID and Others: We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of TrustedID, our employees, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
