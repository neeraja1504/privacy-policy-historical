Second, we collect information to process and fulfill your product orders. If we want to collect information for other purposes, we will inform you when we collect the information.
On occasion, TrueShip may also share non-personal, summary information regarding our customers with unrelated third parties (for example, we publicly disclose the aggregate number of registered users of our software).
