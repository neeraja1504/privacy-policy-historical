We or our advertising service providers may use information about your activities on the Site and/or Third Party Sites (such as the pages that you visit and the key words that you use to search for content) to help determine what advertisements or offers might be of interest to you.  These advertisements may be on the Site or on Third Party Sites.  The use of information in this manner is referred to as "online behavioral advertising."   We believe that online behavioral advertising helps to provide you with more relevant advertising based on the websites that you visit.
You may opt-out of online behavioral advertising by following the instructions in the "Your Options" section of this Online Privacy Policy.  Please note that opting out of online behavioral advertising will not stop you from receiving advertisements.  However, the advertisements that you see may not be as relevant to you.
