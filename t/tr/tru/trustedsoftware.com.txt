How We Use Your Information
Our primary goal is to make our Services more useful to you. By knowing about you, we and our Partners are able to deliver relevant Services and Offers.
Research. We study users' demographics and interests using your information. We also use cookies, may use pixels, and server log files to better understand and serve you. We compile and analyze this information on an aggregated basis. We also may share this aggregated data periodically with current and potential Partners.
Third Parties and Advertising. Third parties advertise on our Sites and during Product installation. These third parties may seek to use cookies and pixel tags, including those collected on our Site, to track Session Data about the ads you have seen and types of things in which you appear interested. These third parties may also use combined information about your visits to our Site and other sites in order to provide advertisements about related goods and services that may be of interest to you. You can opt-out of the third party advertising program by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative website. Opting out of a network does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage patterns.
When you click on a third party advertisers' link from our Site, you will enter the third party's site. We are not responsible for such third party's sites. You should carefully review the privacy statements of any other site you visit, because those privacy statements will apply to your visit to that site, and may be very different from our policy.
How We Share Your Information
Partners sponsor Offers through the software. You should always assume data collected when you fill-in an Offer will be shared with a Partner. If an Offer requires you to leave our Sites, you should know that our Partners may collect Personally Identifiable Information about you. We do not control these Partner sites. This Privacy Policy does not cover our partners’ websites and information practices. Once you have voluntarily submitted information to our Partners, your personal information is subject to their privacy policy. We have no liability or responsibility for these privacy policies or the use of any Personally Identifiable Information transferred to Partners.
The following describes some of the ways that we may disclose your information to our Partners:
Search Partners. We may transmit your search queries (made on the Sites or within one of our Software Offers) to search Partners, who use this information to provide us with search results, which we then will display to you.
Third-Party Advertisements and Software. When you request or submit your information online to a Partner in response to any Offer, we transfer your information for each request made to that Partner. Once we transfer your Personally Identifiable Information, such information becomes subject to the Partners’ privacy policy.
Legal Disclosure. We may also disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our policies or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights, property, users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose user information, as required by law, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or to comply with a judicial procedure served on our sites; or if the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain service and improve our Products and Services.
Sale, Merger or Asset Transfer. We may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that we or all of our assets are acquired, customer information, including any information collected through the Sites or the Services would be one of the transferred assets.
Your Choices
