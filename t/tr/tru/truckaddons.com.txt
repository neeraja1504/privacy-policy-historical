Credit Card Charges:
Credit card charges will be from Truck and Auto Extras , the parent company of TruckAddons.com.
In most cases we will provide you with a tracking number within 3-5 business days of placing your order without having to request it. Most orders are processed and shipped within this time frame.
TruckAddons.com ships from our main warehouse in Lexington Kentucky, but we also ship from multiple warehouses across the country as well as shipping directly from 500+ manufacturers straight to you when needed. This can cause delays in providing the customer a tracking number. Often, customers will receive their order before we are able to supply them their tracking number on drop ship or factory direct orders. If you would like to request a tracking number, please use the tracking request form.
In most cases, products ordered from TruckAddons.com will ship within 24-48 hours of placement (EXCLUDING weekends and holidays). On occasion, parts will need to be custom made/factory special ordered. When a product must be special ordered from the manufacturer or when a product is backordered the delivery time will in most cases increase.
