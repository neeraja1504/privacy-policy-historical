8. Security
We use a combination of encryption techniques firewall barriers, and authentication procedures, among others, to maintain the security of your online session and to protect the Service from unauthorized access.
Our servers are in a secure facility. Our databases are protected from general employee access both physically and logically. We encrypt your Service password so that your password cannot be recovered, even by us. All backup drives and tapes also are encrypted.
We enforce physical access controls to our buildings.
No employee may put any sensitive content on any insecure machine (i.e., nothing can be taken from the database and put on an insecure laptop).
When you enter sensitive information (such as financial information) on our forms we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). This enables client and server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering and message forgery. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at support@trustly.com.
