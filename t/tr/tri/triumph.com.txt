While you are browsing the Site, we automatically log your IP address (a number assigned to your computer when you use the Internet) and your activity while using the Site. Additionally, in order to personalize and enhance your experience on the Site, we may also collect information through "cookies." Cookies are small strings of text that are sent by the Site to your browser and then stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the Site. We also use cookies to gather broad demographic information and to help identify you in respect to visits to the Site so that we may improve your user experience, and to determine whether you visited the Site from a particular Internet link or advertisement. While a code in the cookie file enables the Site to label you as a particular user, including identifying you by name, address, or other personally identifiable information, such cookie files are encrypted in order to protect your information. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but it is possible to change your browser setup so that it does not accept cookies. However, rejecting cookies may prevent you from taking advantage of certain portions of the Site.
Google Analytics.
The Site also may use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (" Google "). Google Analytics also uses cookies to help analyze how users use the Site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Please note that we use Google Analytics with the "_anonymizeIP()" extension, which deletes part of your IP address so it cannot be traced to an individual user. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Site, compiling reports on Site activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. By using the Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set forth above.

THIRD PARTY WEBSITES AND SERVICES
Triumph may reference, provide links to or include features or functionality on the Site that connect or link to third party websites, services or servers. We are not responsible for these third party websites, services and servers, and you should review the privacy policies posted on such sites or otherwise available for such services. In this regard, as noted above, to the extent any credit card payment information (including the number, security code and expiration date) is submitted by you in connection with your use of the Site, such information is not collected by Triumph but rather is sent directly to a third party payment processor. In addition, we use a third party service provider in connection with our ratings and review feature on our Site and such provider collects user information from the Site. The applicable privacy policy for the service provider providing the ratings and review feature can be found at http://bazaarvoice.com/privacy-policy. Triumph may use additional service providers, which similarly collect user information and have their own privacy policies, to provide specific Site features or functionality in the future. Please be aware that Triumph does not control, nor are we responsible for, the privacy policies or information practices of any such third parties (such as third party payment processors or providers of our ratings and review feature or other features) or their websites or services. By using a specific feature or functionality, you consent to the transfer, collection and use of your information to or by the third party service provider providing such feature or functionality.
MODIFICATIONS
We strive to maintain the accuracy of any personally identifiable information that may be collected from you, and will use our commercially reasonable efforts to respond promptly to update our database when you tell us the information in our database is not accurate. It is your responsibility to ensure that such information is accurate, complete and up-to-date. If you wish to make any changes to any personally identifiable information you have provided to us, you may do so at any time by logging into your customer account, if applicable, and making any such changes, or by contacting us via email at info@shop-us.triumph.com.
OPT IN / OPT OUT
The Site allows you to opt in to receive our newsletter and/or other information and materials from us and our affiliates regarding our products and services. If you choose to opt in to receive such materials or communications, you may at any time opt out of receiving such materials and communications by following the opt-out link provided in any email received. Please note, however, that after you unsubscribe from our newsletter, we may still need to contact you with important transactional information related to your account and/or products you have purchased. For example, even if you have unsubscribed from our newsletter, we will still send you emails confirming your account preferences.
CONSEQUENCES OF NOT PROVIDING INFORMATION
You may choose not to provide us with your personally identifiable information. However, choosing not to provide certain requested personally identifiable information may prevent you from accessing and taking advantage of certain products and/or services offered by Triumph.
CHILDREN
This Site is not intended for children under the age of 13. Accordingly, in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 6501-06 and 16 C.F.R. §§ 312.1-312.12, we will not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age. In addition, we do not permit children under 18 years of age to purchase products or to register for an account on the Site. By using the Site, you represent that you are not under 13 years of age. Further, by registering for an account with Triumph and/or purchasing products via the Site, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age, and have the right to form legally binding contracts and to perform your obligations hereunder.
PROTECTING YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
Because security is important to both Triumph and you, we maintain data handling and storage practices and procedures that are designed to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Industry standard Internet security methods and technologies, such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, are used in an effort to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information. SSL encrypts the transmissions from our ecommerce servers as well as your computer. SSL encryption works by forming a matched pair with the transmission from your computer transmission and our server, so that only data to and from these sources can be valid. If you are a registered user, typically, information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted. For certain categories of data, we may also tell you from time to time about specific data retention practices. You should not share your account password with anyone. In addition, if you suspect unauthorized access to your account information, it is your responsibility to contact Triumph immediately. Please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security (for example, as a result of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate applicable law or the policies of the Site and our service providers).
BUSINESS TRANSFER
Triumph may, in the future, sell or otherwise transfer some or all of its assets to a third party. Your personally identifiable information and/or technical information we obtain from you via the Site may be disclosed to any potential or actual third party purchasers of such assets and/or may be among those assets transferred.
ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS
This Privacy Statement is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the Triumph Terms of Use. By using the Site and voluntarily providing your personally identifiable information to us, you consent to the collection and use of such personally identifiable information as set forth in this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Statement, please do not provide us with any information and do not use the Site.

Please note that the personal information you submit to our Site will be transferred to the United States to be processed by us in order to provide the Site and our services to you or for such other purposes as set forth in this Privacy Statement.
