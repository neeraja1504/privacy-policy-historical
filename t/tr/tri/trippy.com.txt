We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Use.
Information We Collect
User-Provided Information: You provide us information about yourself, such as your first name, last name, email, password, photo, hometown, and Facebook friend connections, if you register for a Member account with the Service, including by "following," "becoming a fan," or adding the Trippy application, etc., on a third party service such as Facebook. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, including the names of those individuals you chat with, as well as any information in User Content you post to the Service.
Device Identifiers: When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers."

A device identifier may be used in conjunction with other information in a manner that may constitute personally identifiable information. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers are impaired or disabled. Trippy may access, collect and/or store device identifiers once you enable Trippy's Services on your mobile device.

Legal bases for processing (for EEA users):
If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases depend on the services of the site you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:
We need it to provide you the services, including to operate the services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the services;
It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests;
You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or
We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.
If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.
Specifically, if you decide you want to sign up for a user account on Trippy, we ask you to consent to the sharing of your personal information needed to create the account. At any time, you can request removal of your Trippy account and any posts you made on the site, as well as all related personal data.
