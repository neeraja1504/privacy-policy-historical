Information We Collect
The TriNet.com website collects identifying information such as, your name, company name, company address and other contact information. We, TriNet, will never sell, rent, lend or trade this information in our possession to any other company for the purpose of contacting you regarding commercial services. If you are a TriNet customer or worksite employee of a customer, we collect the information necessary to provide our services, collecting it either from you directly or from your worksite employer. This collection is limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the customer has engaged TriNet. By voluntarily providing information or by accessing our websites, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and, if applicable, the International Policy.
When you download and/or use our services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or "UDID"). We do not ask for, access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile apps or services.
Usage Tracking and Cookies
Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by TriNet and our affiliates, analytics service providers, and third party providers of HR services we have engaged. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an aggregated basis and, in the case of registered users, on an individual basis, as well.
For example we track user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites, but this tracking is never associated with non-registered individual users. We compile aggregate data mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you go to next (whether this URL is on our site or not), and what browser and computing platform you are using.
In addition, we use cookies on certain pages of our sites. We may also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie. Cookies enable you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide you information that is targeted to your interests. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our sites. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning they are automatically deleted at the end of a session. We also use persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time and remembers your preferences. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our sites, and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session. Our affiliates, tracking utility company, and service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.
As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. To manage Flash cookies please click here.
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.
If you send us proposals or personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on our sites, we may collect and store such information in a file specific to you. If you submit questions via our sites, we may post your questions on the sites, and reprint them in various articles and customer communications. We will never include the name, contact or other identifiable information of people who submit questions, regardless of which channel we use to distribute content.
We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other websites. Our third party partner may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you with advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising click here (or if located in the European Union click here.) Please note that you will continue to receive generic ads.
Use of Information
We use personally identifiable information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze site usage, improve our content product offerings, customize our sites' content, layout and services, and provide our services (if applicable).
We may use the email address, mailing address, and phone number we collect from you to respond to your inquiries and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to contact you regarding administrative notices, new product offerings and communications relevant to your use of our sites. In some cases, we may use your personally identifiable information to inform you of new services, promotions and other matters targeted to your interests. You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, accessing the email preferences in your account settings page or by contacting the appropriate customer support office.
We use information in the file we maintain specific to you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on our sites, to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes and we may evaluate information about you to look for users using multiple User IDs or aliases.
Children's Privacy
TriNet’s websites are intended for adults. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we obtain knowledge that we have personally identifiable information about a child under 13 in retrievable form in our files, we will delete that information from our existing files. However, we will retain information from adult registered users about their dependents for purposes of administering benefits for their dependents, including dependents under the age of 13.
Customers and Worksite Employees of TriNet
If you are a customer (also referred to as a worksite employer) or worksite employee serviced by TriNet, you are a registered user and we may collect and maintain personally identifiable information including, but not limited to, name, address, phone number, social security number, taxpayer identification number, age, marital status, occupation, salary, benefits, dependent information, etc. through TriNet service websites or other means disclosed to you. This information will be used to provide our professional employer and other HR-related services, which may include sharing such information with your worksite employer to the extent permitted by applicable law.
Once you receive a username and password, you can review and change the information you submitted during registration. If your registration information changes, you must promptly update, change or delete your registration information by logging into your information page or by contacting the appropriate customer support office. We will respond to your inquiries about your personal information within 30 days. We may retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. Further, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally identifiable information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.
Disclosure of Information
Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing): we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process; we may use information when we believe in good faith that it is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others; and we may respond to any other third party requests with your prior consent to do so.
Third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we employ industry-standard practices to protect your privacy, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain private.
As a general proposition, we do not sell, rent, lend or trade any personally identifiable information about you to any third party. The following paragraphs describe some of the ways that personally identifiable information about you may be disclosed to third parties..
Legal Requests
We cooperate with law enforcement and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property rights and other rights. Therefore, local, state, federal, territorial, provincial and international law enforcement can request and may receive your personally identifiable information. By your use of the TriNet.com website, TriNet’s service websites, or TriNet's services (as applicable), you hereby accept these terms and you authorize us to disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.
Business Transactions
We reserve the right to transfer personally identifiable information as part of a sale or transfer of all or a relevant portion of our business or assets. Any such sale would be subject to appropriate privacy protections for you. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.
Suppliers and Other Service Providers
We may use third-party suppliers and service providers to facilitate provision of our professional employer and HR-related services. For example, we may outsource the operations of one or more aspects of our sites to a supplier or service provider who performs services according to our requirements. In all cases, we restrict how these suppliers and other service providers may access, use and disclose information received from our websites. We do not permit these suppliers and other service providers to access information about you, other than that information necessary for them to complete the services for which they are contracted. Under no circumstances do we allow them to disclose, sell, rent, lend, trade or in any other way transmit data about you to third parties, and we use contractual means to require them to provide appropriate protection for your personally identifiable information and to use it only for the services for which they are contracted.
Retention of Information
We retain personally identifiable information that we collect only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and to meet legal requirements. We have a Business Record Retention Policy and an E-mail Retention Policy which provide for the destruction of personally identifiable information after it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected and legal requirements have been met.
Security
We use industry standard methods, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers (SSL), to safeguard the confidentiality of personally identifiable information about you. For registered users, personally identifiable information will include name, address, contact information, social security number, date of birth and payroll and benefits information related to the services we provide to registered users. Using SSL means that data such as names and passwords cannot be easily deciphered by outside users.
Referrals
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our website, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. You must have the consent of your friend to provide us with this information. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website. This email will identify that you asked for it to be sent. TriNet may store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact the appropriate customer support office to request that we remove this information from our database.
Social Media Widgets
Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook button, and widgets, such as the ShareThis button, or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
Access
We will allow you access to your Personal Information and allow you to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information, except to the extent permitted by applicable law where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than you would be violated. If access to Personal Information is denied, we will provide you with the reason for such denial. You may request the correction, amendment or deletion of your innacurate personal information by contacting us at myhr@trinet.com. We will respond to these requests within a reasonable timeframe.

Introduction
TriNet delivers HR outsourcing services that allow companies to do what they do best. Thousands of employers have turned to TriNet for human resources, benefits, payroll, workers' compensation and strategic human capital services. As their trusted HR advisor, TriNet helps these employers contain HR costs, minimize employer-related risk and relieve the administrative burden of HR. TriNet's suite of HR outsourcing services includes coordination of services to its customers’ locations and worksite employees outside of the United States. In order for TriNet to provide this vast array of services, TriNet must collect certain personal information regarding the worksite employees of its customers.
Protecting customer and employee privacy is important to TriNet. TriNet adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles concerning the transfer of personal data from locations in the European Union (EU) and Switzerland to the United States and adheres to Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act ("PIPEDA") and the applicable provincial privacy legislation.

All such information is transmitted to the United States and is maintained in San Leandro, California; Reno, Nevada; Bradenton, Florida; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Fort Mill, South Carolina; and New York City, New York, which may have privacy and data protection laws that differ from those in the country in which an employee resides. As a result, Personal Information may be subject to access requests from U.S. government agencies, courts and law enforcement officials in accordance with U.S. laws.
Definition of Personal Information
"Personal Information" or "Information" means information that 1) is transferred from outside of the United States to TriNet; 2) is recorded in any form; 3) is about or pertains to a specific individual; and 4) can be linked to that individual. Accordingly, this policy applies to you if information linked to you is transferred to TriNet in any recorded form from outside the United States.
