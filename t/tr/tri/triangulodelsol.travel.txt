Disclosure of Your Information
Personal Information. We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated in this Privacy Policy or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. We may share personal information with:
Other Registered Members
We will disclose your profile information (including photos) to other registered members as a critical part of the provision of our Services. [We may also make features available enabling other registered members to share your profile information, including photos, with members of their social network(s). We never share your contact information with other registered members of the Services.]
Service Providers
We may share information, including personal information, with third parties that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, ad tracking and analytics, member screenings, supporting our website functionality, and supporting surveys and other features offered through our Services. We may also share your name, contact information and credit card information with our service providers who process credit card payments. Your personal information will be treated as private and confidential by such service providers and not used for any purposes other than the functions which we authorize.
Business Partners
When you register as a member on our Services or click-through our advertisements offered on third party websites or applications, we may share personal information with the businesses with which we partner to offer you the applicable products, services or any advertisements. When you elect to engage in a particular merchant's offer or program, you authorize us to provide your email address and other information to that merchant.
Miscellaneous.
We also may disclose your information, including personal information: (i) if required to do so by law or regulation; (ii) if we believe, in our sole discretion, that disclosure is reasonable to comply with the law, requests or orders from law enforcement, or any legal process (whether or not such disclosure is required by applicable law); (iii) if we believe, in our sole discretion, that disclosure is reasonable to protect or defend gatherX’s or a third-party’s rights or property or to enforce our terms of use or other agreements or policies; (iv) if we believe, in our sole discretion, that disclosure is reasonable to protect someone’s health or safety, such as when harm or violence against any person (including you) is threatened; (v) if we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; and (vi) in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale.
Non-Personal Information. The Australian Privacy Principles do not apply to non-personal information (including aggregated information), and therefore we may use and disclose such information for any purpose and by any means whatsoever, provided such use is also in compliance with the applicable laws of all jurisdictions in which such information has been obtained or is being disseminated. By way of example, we may share non-personal information and/or aggregated information (i) with third parties to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our Services and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising, and (ii) or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis or other business purposes. Some portions of your account profile may be available to search engine crawlers and thus may appear in internet searches, but no personal information will be included in such search results. For example, we may engage a data provider who may collect web log data from you, or place a cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized advertisements. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (such as your email address), that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.
Links to or Access from Other Sites
You may be able to access your account from third-party sites, such as social networking sites, by way of various applications. In addition, there are places on our Services where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. These third-party sites, which we do not control, may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices or the content of any other websites or applications that may provide access to, or be linked to or from, our Services, including that of any social networking sites and third-party advertisers whose offerings require you to navigate away from our Services.
Public Forums
Our Services may include interactive forums such as chat rooms, messaging channels and message boards. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
What Choices Do You Have Regarding Your Information
You can choose not to provide us with certain information, however, by doing so you may be unable to use certain features of our Services because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member, purchase paid Premium memberships products or services, ask a question or initiate transactions. Many of the choices you have are built directly into your account settings. For example, you can access and change information in your profile page at any time. You can link or unlink your gatherX account from an account on another social media platform. You can close your account at any time, but please be aware that we may retain archived copies of your information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (including, without limitation, to address spam and fraud, collect any fees owed, for recordkeeping purposes, to take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our Services or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law). In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies.
Security
We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. These measures include the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and/or strong encryption (3DES) technology during credit card transactions and administrative access to our Services data. We will exercise reasonable care in providing secure transmission of information between your device and our servers, but given that no information transmitted over the internet can be guaranteed 100% secure, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over the internet and therefore accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email.
Information You Provide About Yourself
You can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others or upload content such as photographs on our Services. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are performed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.
Protection of Children’s Privacy
We restrict the use of our Services to individuals age 13 and above and do not target children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13, and in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, any information which we may receive from users that we become aware of are under the age of 13 will be purged from our database.
Using Our Services Outside Australia
If you are using our Services from outside Australia, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in Australia where our servers are located and our central database is operated. By using our Services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.
No Rights of Third Parties
This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the Services.
