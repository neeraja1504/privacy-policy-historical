11. Analysis
For the purposes of analyzing and optimizing our websites, we use different services that are described in the following. This allows us to analyze, for example, how many users visit our site, which information is requested the most, and how users find the website. The data that we collect includes the websites from which a person in question arrives at a website (“referrer”), which subpages on the website are accessed and how often, and the length of time for which a subpage is viewed. This helps us to develop and improve our website to be more user-friendly. The data collected does not serve to personally identify individual users. Anonymous or highly pseudonymous data will be collected. The legal basis for this is article 6, par. 1 f of the GDPR.
11.1 Google Analytics
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). This use covers the Universal Analytics operating mode. This makes it possible to assign data, sessions, and interactions across multiple devices to a pseudonymous user ID and thus analyze a user’s activities across devices.
Google Analytics uses cookies that allow your use of the website to be analyzed. The information generated by the cookie through your use of this website is generally transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. If IP anonymization is activated on this website, however, your IP address will be truncated in advance within the member states of the European Union or other contracting states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional circumstances will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. The IP address transmitted from your browser in the context of Google Analytics will not be conflated with other Google data. Google will use this information in this website operator’s order to evaluate your use of the website so that reports about website activity can be compiled and other services connected to website and internet use can be rendered for the website operator. Our legitimate interest in data processing is also for these purposes. The legal basis for the use of Google Analytics is article 6, par. 1 f of the GDPR. The data sent by us and connected to cookies, user information (such as user ID), and promotional IDs are deleted after 14 months after the last use of our services. Data whose storage period has expired is automatically deleted once a month.

12.1 Google AdWords and Conversion Tracking
To draw attention to our services, we place Google AdWords display ads and, within this context, use Google conversion tracking for the purposes of personalized online ads based on interests and location. The option to anonymize IP addresses is controlled through Google Tag Manager, via an internal setting that is not visible in the source of this page. This internal setting is set so that the anonymization required by privacy laws covers IP addresses.
Ads are displayed based on search requests on websites in the Google ad network. We have the ability to combine our ads with certain search terms. With the use of cookies, we are able to place ads based on previous user visits to our website.
When a user clicks on an ad, Google places a cookie on the user’s device. For more information on the cookie technology used, please see Google’s statements on website statistics and their data privacy policy.
With the use of this technology, Google, and we as their customer, receive the information that a user has clicked on an ad and was redirected to our websites. The information acquired this way is solely used for statistical analysis related to ad optimization. We do not receive any information that would allow us to personally identify a visitor. The statistics provided to us by Google include the total number of users who have clicked on one of our ads and, where applicable, whether they were redirected to a page on our website that has a conversation tag. These statistics allow us to track which search terms most often lead to our ads receiving clicks, and which ads lead to the user contacting us via the contact form.
If you do not want this, you can prevent the storage of the cookies required for this technology by, for example, using the settings in your browser or your App. Should you do so, your visit will not be incorporated into user statistics.
You also have the option to choose the types of Google ads or deactivate interest-based ads on Google through ad settings. Alternatively, you can deactivate third-party use of cookies by using the Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out tool.

13. Data transmission
Your data will not be transmitted to third parties as a general rule unless we are legally obligated to do so or the transfer of data is necessary for implementing the contractual relationship or you have given prior express consent to have your data transferred.
External service providers and affiliated companies, such as online payment vendors communication agents, will only receive your data to the extent necessary to process your request. In these cases, however, the extent of data transmitted is kept to the necessary minimum. If our service providers come into contact with your personally identifiable information, we will make sure that this complies with the regulations of data protection laws in the same way through the course of processing the order in accordance with article 28 of the GDPR. Please note the vendor’s respective data privacy policy as well. The respective vendor is responsible for the content of third-party services, although we review services for compliance with legal requirements to a reasonable extent.
We emphasize processing your data within the EU/EEA. However, it may happen that we use service providers who process data outside the EU/EEA. In these cases, we make sure that a reasonable level of data protection is established with the recipient before transmitting your personally identifiable information. This means that a level of data protection is reached through EU standard contracts or an adequacy decision that is comparable to the standard within the EU.
14. Data security
We have taken extensive technical and operational security precautions to protect your data from being accidentally or intentionally manipulated, lost, destroyed, or accessed by unauthorized persons. Our security measures are reviewed regularly and updated in keeping with technological advances.
