Privacy Policy - tripcentral.ca
The Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) was enacted on January 1, 2001 to ensure all Canadian's basic right to privacy. PIPEDA applies to every business in Canada and covers the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information about identifiable individuals.
At Tripcentral.ca, we value your trust and believe in the importance of protecting the privacy of the individual. A travel enquiry and purchase requires the voluntary disclosure of personal information and an exchange of that information with various third party suppliers. We have appointed a Privacy Officer to handle requests for information; ensure our Privacy Protection Policy complies with the legislation; oversee the integrity of our systems and monitor end supplier adherence to PIPEDA.
The following Privacy Protection Policy was updated and posted on Tripcentral.ca on January 11, 2004. Questions regarding the policy and it's implementation should be e-mailed to privacy@tripcentral.ca or mailed to:

Credit card details are required internally or by end suppliers for settlement of purchases. Citizenship and Immigration status is required by the Travel Industry Act (TICO) to ensure travellers are advised of correct travel documentation. Place of birth, nationality, age, passport details are also required by airlines to comply with Canadian Transportation Act (CTA) regulations and governments for visas and travel documents.
Birth dates are required in order to purchase insurance, to receive special rates (e.g. senior, youth, child fares) and facilitate unaccompanied minor (UM) service.
Additional personal ID numbers and preferences such as frequent flyer numbers, past passenger numbers, car ID numbers, hotel ID numbers and seat requests are needed to accrue personal rewards and to access special rates and services.

Tripcentral.ca collects your name and contact information (telephone number and email address) when a travel enquiry is opened. In order to process the request and complete a reservation additional information is collected about each traveller along with his or her preferences.
Use of Personal Information
Tripcentral.ca uses the personal information in order to process and compete travel inquires and reservations. The records are maintained for seven (7) years from date of booking (six years full calendar years plus the year of the transaction) as required by Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA). Tripcentral.ca does not sell or distribute any personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.
Third Party Suppliers In order to complete travel bookings certain personal information is passed on to third party Canadian and non-Canadian suppliers such as airlines, cruise lines and hotels. The information varies according to the type of travel booked. For example, a name and car ID number is required in order to complete a car reservation. A name, date of birth and place of residence is required for an insurance policy. A name, phone number, credit card number, expiry date and room preference is required to complete a sun vacation booking.
It is important to note that because Tripcentral.ca acts as the agent during the process of requesting and booking travel you are also a client and the third party supplier. As such your personal information is therefore covered by that third party suppler's privacy policy over which Tripcentral.ca has no control.
Tripcentral.ca sends the minimum required personal information to the third party suppliers and does not sell any data (individually or in bulk).
Legal Obligations Tripcentral.ca may be required by law to disclose certain personal information in cases of illegal activities or in order to resolve disputes that arise in the normal course of business.
Communications You will be contacted by telephone and email by a tripcentral.ca agent with respect to your travel enquiry. Should you not wish to engage in communications with respect to this enquiry, simply tell our agent by phone or email and they will close your travel enquiry. All marketing communications engaged by tripcentral.ca are respectful and designed to be mutually beneficial. Customers will be placed on an email newsletter list for which will contain and opt out link. The email distribution is provided by a third party company under contract for privacy/non solicitation of your email address. From time to time, a tripcentral.ca agent may follow up on our past customers by telephone or email at a time of year germane to your previous travel purchase. For example, if you traveled in the past at New Years, our agent may contact you when new pricing is loaded for the next New Year's travel period. You also have the option to never have us contact you for marketing purposes â€“ each agent has a "do not call", "do not email", and "do not mail" (other than invoices related to travel services purchased) flag which can be set in your profile. It's important to remember that the do not contact settings are per person, and not per household.
