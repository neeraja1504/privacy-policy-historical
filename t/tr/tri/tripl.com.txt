We only process relevant and necessary personal data
EWII only processes data about you that are relevant and adequate in relation to the purposes defined above. The purpose is decisive for the type of data about you relevant to us. This also applies to the extent of the personal data we use, meaning that we will not process more data than those required for the specific purpose.
EWII only collects, processes and stores the personal data necessary to fulfil our purpose. In addition, legislation may dictate particular types of data that we must collect and store for our business operations. The type and extent of the personal data we process may also be determined by the need to meet a contractual or other legal obligation.
Disclosure of your personal data
We disclose and make available your data to other companies in the EWII Group as well as to other external suppliers and business partners to the necessary and relevant extent. In such cases, your personal data will only be processed in accordance with EWII's instructions to such third party, just as the company in the EWII Group responsible for processing the data and the third party that processes the data on behalf of EWII will conclude a data processing agreement.
We may disclose and make available your personal data to consolidated undertakings and external undertakings for purposes such as registration of customer relations, invoicing, case handling and other administrative processes as well as in connection with market surveys, marketing and the like.
We will ask for your consent before we process your personal data
We will obtain your consent before we process your personal data for the purposes outlined above, unless we are otherwise entitled to process them, e.g. where processing is necessary for the performance of our agreement with you.
Your consent is voluntary, and you may withdraw it at any time by contacting us. Use the contact details below if you would like more information.
We protect your personal data and have adopted internal information security rules
EWII takes IT and data security seriously, and we have adopted internal rules on information security that contain instructions and measures to protect your personal data from being destroyed, lost or changed, to prevent unauthorised disclosure and to ensure that no unauthorised persons gain access to or knowledge of them.
You have a right of access to your personal data
You have the right at any time to know which data we process about you, where they come from and what we use them for. You can also be informed of how long we store your personal data, and who will receive data about you if we disclose data in Denmark and abroad.
At your request, we will inform you of access to the data processed about you.
Access may, however, be restricted out of consideration for other people's privacy, trade secrets and intellectual property rights.
Contact us if you wish to have access to your data. Our contact details are shown below.
You have the right to have inaccurate personal data rectified or deleted
If you believe that the personal data we process about you are inaccurate, we would very much like to hear from you. You have the right to have inaccurate or incorrect data rectified. Please contact us and describe the inaccuracies and how we should correct your data.
In some cases, we have an obligation to delete your personal data. This applies, for example, if you withdraw your consent. If you believe that your data are no longer required for the purpose for which we collected them, you may ask to have them deleted.
When you submit a request for rectification or deletion of your personal data, we will investigate whether the conditions have been fulfilled and, if that is the case, we will meet your request as quickly as possible. You should also contact us if you suspect that your personal data are being processed in violation of the law or other legal obligations.
You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data
You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data. You can also object to our disclosure of your data for marketing purposes. Use the contact details at the bottom to submit your objection.
If your objection is justified, we will stop processing your personal data.
