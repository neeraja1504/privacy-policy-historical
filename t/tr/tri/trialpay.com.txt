We receive Personal Information (including Card Transaction Data) from our clients as well as from your payment card issuer, merchants, acquirers, payment processors, service providers, and other third parties. For example, we may collect Personal Information from third party digital wallets and online merchants when you make an online purchase.

We treat this information as Personal Information when it is associated with other data elements that allow us to identify, locate or contact you.
How We Use Personal Information
We may use your Personal Information to:
Enable your payment card transactions, including for related purposes, such as authentication, fraud prevention, and dispute resolution,

Provide you with the products, content or services you request from us or a third party, including for related purposes such as determining eligibility, sending service messages and for customer service and account management, including (for example) to provide you with our offers and other partner promotions when you enroll in those programs,

Visa Marketing Solutions
In some countries, Visa enhances Card Transaction Data and uses it to generate anonymized and aggregated consumer spending and marketing reports and other data products that enable companies to improve their marketing efforts. These solutions help companies identify consumers that they can target. For example, a marketing report may show that consumers in one ZIP code tend to spend more at auto parts stores than consumers in other ZIP codes. These products also help companies determine the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns.
Visa’s marketing solutions do not contain any Personal Information, but they do allow companies to enhance their own consumer files with intelligence to support targeted marketing.
