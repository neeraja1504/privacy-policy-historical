Privacy - Trip Database
This privacy notice has been updated in light of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  which was introduced in May 2018.  For further information on GDPR you can view information via the EU, Wikipedia or ICO (others sources are available).
The Trip Database is a clinical search engine aimed at helping health professionals find trusted answers to their clinical questions.
The privacy of our users is important to us and we have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain to you how we collect, use, and share information we obtain through your use of the website.
What information is being collected?
At Trip we collect data at two main points:
At registration. This includes name, email, profession, country of residence, areas of clinical interest and institution.
When a user searches Trip we collect data (called clickstream or web log data) on search terms, articles viewed and IP address all date stamped. If the user is logged in this is linked to the account, if not it is held as anonymised data (albeit associated with an IP address).
If you subscribe to the Services or make a purchase, we collect your payment method.
How is it collected?
The registration data is collected from the registration form while the clickstream data is collected automatically as you, the users, uses the site.
Why is it being collected?
We collect the data for a number of reasons:
To understand who our users are.
To improve the service we offer.
To help ensure communications are appropriately targeted.
How will it be used?
We use the clickstream data to look for patterns in the data. This can be used to improve the search results and has the potential to be useful for research and educational purposes.
Who will it be shared with?
We do not share your personalised information outside of Trip, by that we mean no names, emails etc. However, we sometimes share the clickstream data with trusted third party organisations (typically academic) for the purpose of research and development. This is done to either support an improved Trip Database experience for users (by improving things like the search results, rapid reviews) or to help with other related projects (such as helping to identify common search queries with a view to improving research procurement). Where we share data it is amalgamated data and no personal identifiers are shared (although IP data may be shared).
Data Retention
We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.
How does the Trip protect data?
Trip takes the security of your data seriously. Trip has controls in place to try to ensure that your data is not lost, accidentally destroyed, misused or disclosed, and is not accessed except by its employees in the performance of their duties
Your choices

Promotional Communications
You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from Trip by following the instructions in those emails (there is an unsubscribe button at the bottom of each email). If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as password reminders etc.
Linking to third party websites
At the core of what Trip does is to link to third part websites. We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other sites even if you access them using links from our Site and recommend that you check the policy of each site you visit and contact its owner or operator if you have any concerns or questions.
In addition, if you linked to this Site from a third party site, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners or operators of that third party site and recommend that you check the policy of that third party site and contact its owner or operator if you have any concerns or questions.
Transferring your information outside of Europe
As part of the services offered to you through the Site, the information you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside of the European Union (“EU”). By way of example, this may happen if any of our servers are from time to time located in a country outside of the EU or one of our service providers is located in a country outside of the EU. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK. If we transfer your information outside of the EU in this way, we will take steps with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this privacy policy.
If you use our services while you are outside the EU, your information may be transferred outside the EU in order to provide you with those services.
