Privacy Policy
Effective Date: January 21, 2014
Hydroxatone, LLC ("Hydroxatone", "we" "us") has developed this Privacy Policy which details important information regarding the use and disclosure of user information collected on this website and other websites owned and operated by Hydroxatone as well as through email or interactive and mobile applications of Hydroxatone ("Hydroxatone Applications"). Hydroxatone provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or participate in the Hydroxatone Applications.
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to Hydroxatone's Terms of Use. Each time that you access or use Hydroxatone Applications you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using the Hydroxatone Applications.
Registration. We will collect personal information from you when you place an order for any Hydroxatone products and services (collectively, "Products"). We may also collect information from you when you interact with our Hydroxatone Applications, interact with other users, and use various features of our Hydroxatone Applications.
Surveys and Promotions. From time-to-time we may request information from you and other users via surveys, contests or sweepstakes. Participation in these surveys, contests or sweepstakes is completely voluntary so you and other users have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information may be used to notify the winners, award prizes and file winner's information as required by law. Survey information will be used for the purpose(s) of the survey, including the monitoring or improvement of the use and satisfaction of Hydroxatone Applications.
Information Shared With Social Networking Sites.  You may be given the option to link your account on third party social networking services so that you can share your information and/or to comment on Hydroxatone products and services or take advantage of other features of Hydroxatone Applications.  In that case, the authentication of your login credentials is conducted through that third party social networking service provider.  If you choose to share information from the Hydroxatone Applications through any social networking service provider you should review the privacy policies of that social networking service provider.  You should make sure that you are comfortable with the information your third party social networking service provider may make available to us by visiting those services' privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy settings directly with those services.  By authorizing the social networking service provider to provide this information to us we reserve the right to use, transfer, assign, sell, share and provide access to such information in the same ways described in this Privacy Policy.
Information You Provide About a Third Party. If you send someone else a communication from the Hydroxatone Applications, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the Hydroxatone Applications, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.
User Generated Content. Please remember that any information you disclose while participating on the Hydroxatone Applications, including our public forums ("Interactive Forums"), becomes public information and is subject to redistribution by Hydroxatone and others who gain access. Therefore, you should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting. There is no expectation of privacy when playing, posting, or otherwise participating on the Hydroxatone Applications or in the Interactive Forums. If you post content, such as messages, photos and videos, please be aware that any personally identifiable information contained in such content is accessible to registered users or visitors to that Hydroxatone Application or Community and we have no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable information. We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with the interactive areas on our Hydroxatone Applications and Interactive Forums. We reserve the right to take action in connection with any content we deem to be inappropriate. Please review our Terms of Use for more information regarding your appropriate use of these areas.
Supplemental Information. We may from time to time supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic and lifestyle information. We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.
Information Collected Through Technology. In addition to any personal information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs. As you use our Hydroxatone Applications, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and services providers to coordinate and record the interactivity and fill your requests for services and information ("Usage Information"). We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our Hydroxatone Applications, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device. Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for your computer or other device used to access the Hydroxatone Applications (any, a "Device"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the device used to access the Hydroxatone Applications, and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our Hydroxatone Applications and the website you visit after you leave our Hydroxatone Applications, if this information is supplied to us by your browser. We may use this Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Hydroxatone Applications.
The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your computers or mobile devices, which are then transmitted back to our Sites by your computers or mobile devices. These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers. For example, when you visit the Hydroxatone Applications, we and our service providers may place cookies on your computers or mobile devices. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return, track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. They also help us provide a customized experience and help us to detect certain kinds of fraud. A "cookie" is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the Sites. Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your activity with the Hydroxatone Applications with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with the Hydroxatone Applications.
Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer. "Session" cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views. Your browser usually erases session cookies once you exit your browser. "Persistent" cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser. We use persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided.
Flash cookies, known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit. Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store Usage Information. Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html. If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Sites may not function properly. If you click on ads that appear on our Hydroxatone Applications, our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your Device. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers; each advertiser's use of cookies is covered by that advertiser's own privacy policy.
Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions, and may be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open or click a link in an email message from us. When you access these pages or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.
We may use HTML5, another form of collection, in our apps for the iphone or iPad (and any other Apple iOS device). HTML5 is another form of collection, tracking and storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies. Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies can be used to track users across websites but are not stored in browers' cookie files. To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.
We sometimes use embedded scripts which are programming codes designed to collect information about your interactions with the Hydroxatone Applications, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Hydroxatone Applications, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to personal information. For example, we use information we collect about Hydroxatone Application users to optimize our services and understand traffic and usage patterns. In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your personal information, we will treat it as personal information.
Third Party Analytics Technologies. We use third parties' analytic and other tools to better understand who is using the Hydroxatone Applications, how people are using the Hydroxatone Applications and how to improve the effectiveness of the Hydroxatone Applications, and to help us serve more targeted content and advertising to you. Those third party companies may use cookies, pixel tags or other technologies to collect and store anonymous information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the Hydroxatone Applications, Device Identifiers, type of operating system and browser used and other web sites you may have visited. We do not have access to, nor control over, third parties' use of cookies or other tracking technologies. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third parties to see your options for opting out of their use of such devices. If you would like more information regarding which third party companies we use to provide these services who may be serving cookies or other tracking tools on our Hydroxatone Applications or want to know more about what your choices are about not having this anonymous collected or used by these companies, please click here.
Our Business Relationship. When you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity or otherwise sign up for our services or provide your contact information, including an email address or telephone number in connection with that activity, product or service, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us. You expressly consent to our communicating with you future information about Hydroxatone using the information you provided to us. You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you. This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.
Connecting with the Hydroxatone Applications and Interactive Forums. By posting to our Interactive Forums, you give us permission to capture and store information you provide us and display it to other users in order to provide the best possible experience on the Hydroxatone Applications. Therefore, you should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting. There is no expectation of privacy in the Interactive Forums and we have no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable information.
Service Providers. We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business and the Hydroxatone Applications or administer activities on our behalf. We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes.
Third Party Advertising. Third parties advertise offers on Hydroxatone Applications and in the course of serving those offers, these third-parties use technology to send, directly to your Device, the advertisements and links that appear on Hydroxatone Applications. They automatically receive your Device Identifier when this happens and use tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements, to personalize the advertising content and for accounting purposes. These third parties may also use combined information about your visits to our Hydroxatone Applications and other sites in order to provide advertisements about related goods and services that may be of particular interest to you. When you click on a third party advertisers' link, you will enter the third party's site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such advertisers or third party ad networks. You should consult the respective privacy policies of any advertisers on Hydroxatone Applications to see your options for opting out of their use of such tracking devices. In addition, some of the ad serving networks may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. If you opt-out of receiving targeted ads on Hydroxatone Applications from ad servers and ad networks, you may continue to receive advertising and promotional messages after you opt-out, but it will not be customized or personalized to you based on your use of our Hydroxatone Applications and/or third party websites. If you would like more information about advertisers' use of tracking technologies and about your option not to accept the cookies used to track your activities, you can go to http://www.networkadvertising.org/. If you would like to learn more about how interest-based information is collected, whether the companies we use are part of an industry network regarding behavioral advertising and to know your choices about not having information used in this manner you can go to http://www.aboutads.info/.
Strategic Partners. From time to time we may enter into a relationship with another company that is not owned by or affiliated with us to provide additional features on the Hydroxatone Applications. These special relationships may include business partners, sponsors and co-branded Hydroxatone Applications (referred to here as "co-branded pages"). Any information, including personally identifiable information that you provide on one of these co-branded pages will be shared with these third party partners. Since these third parties will use your information in accordance with their own privacy practices, you should check their website for information regarding their privacy policies.

Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place. If you do not want us to share your Personal Information with other companies so that they can send you direct mail offers about their products and services, please contact us by any of the methods provided in the Contact Us paragraph below.
