If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order pages. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date) otherwise we cannot process your order. We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.
We collect personal information not only to fulfill your order, but also to make our services more rewarding for you to use. We usually use this information for internal purposes, such as studying our customers' preferences and improving the customer experience. We may also use your information to contact you for account and promotional purposes, including trusted third party promotions.
We may share your personal information with companies that perform services for us, such as fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, conducting surveys, providing customer service, and other similar functions. Such companies may have access to your personal information in order to perform their roles, but they may not disclose your information for other purposes.
Personal information may be transferred in connection with the sale, merger, or acquisition of business assets of SENSA Products, LLC or its parent company. We may share aggregate web site usage information with marketing partners and affiliates, however, this information does not identify individual users. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us.
We may also utilize information you have posted on community forums and message boards for use in marketing and promotions.
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our site, please contact us as indicated below.
