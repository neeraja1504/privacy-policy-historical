our uses a technology called "cookies " to remember you and the information you are saving. When you visit our website, we send you back a cookie, a small text file that includes a temporary inquiry number, your IP address, plus any items you've chosen. The information we store in cookies is also linked to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

What visitor information does the website keep track of?
Information tracked automatically is generic and doesn't include any personal details:
When you log onto the Internet, your computer says to your Internet service, "Here I am; talk to me! " by requesting an IP (Internet Protocol) address, sort of like asking for a seat at an electronic table with numbered seats. Your Internet service's computer responds by saying, "OK, for this session, you sit at #12. " Some providers assign you a permanent or "static " IP address, but most use temporary ones. This helps assure your privacy, because it's difficult - if not impossible - to collect personal information about you via a temporary address.
Our site keeps a general list of visitors' IP addresses. This gives us broad, generic information such as how many Rogers users log onto our website and helps us maintain compatibility with many different Internet services.records browser types and versions so we can answer questions such as, "How many of our visitors were using Google Chrome last month? " This tells us what features our visitors can make use of and helps us keep our website up to date.
