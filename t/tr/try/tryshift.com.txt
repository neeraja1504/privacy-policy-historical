Thank you for visiting www.tryshift.com (the “Site”). The Site is an Internet property of Redbrick Technologies Inc. and its affiliated companies (“Redbrick”, “our”, “we” or “us”). Redbrick is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to describe to you and to outline our practices and policies associated with any information (such as the Application Data, Anonymous Data, and Personal Data, each as defined below) that we may collect from you, or that you may share with us when you access or use the Site, use the Shift application (the “Software”), or use any related products and/or services.
Lawful Basis for Processing Data
In certain jurisdictions, the processing of your Personal Data (as defined below) is lawful only if it is permitted under data protection legislation. In this case, we have a lawful basis for each of our processing activities (unless an exemption applies) as outlined below:
Consent. By using the Site, the Software, or otherwise submitting your Personal Data to us, you consent to our collection, use and sharing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Legitimate Interest. We will process your Personal Data based on Legitimate Interest, and particularly where it is used for marketing and business purposes, and to contact you to start a conversation regarding your use of the Site or the Software.

Legal Obligation. We may also process your Personal Data based on other lawful basis such as where the processing is necessary to comply with applicable law.
How We Collect and Use Personal and Anonymous Data
When you access the Site, purchase, download trial or evaluation versions, register for any associated products and/or services, or use the Software, we may collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you. We may also collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data when you send us information or communications. “Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example and without limitation, your name, phone number, physical address, Internet Protocol (IP) address, credit card information, and email address for the purposes of recording the transaction when you access the Site or when you use any of the Software or any associated products and/or services. “Anonymous Data” refers to data about you that is not associated with, or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. When you link third-party Accounts like Google or Outlook to the Software, nothing is collected from these accounts. As such, Personal Data and Anonymous Data expressly exclude any information that could be collected by way of linking your accounts. This data is only stored locally on your computer system and thus does not constitute any part of data that we collect. In most cases, Personal Data collection occurs when you provide such data directly to us, when you use the Software to connect your email address(es) or to access your event data, or if such information and data is required in order for us to provide the Software and related services to you.
To make our website and Software more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) may collect Personal Data, Anonymous Data, or Application Data from you such as browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, domain name, Software usage and statistics, and/or a date/time stamp of your visit. We may also use cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) and referring URLs to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit. We may also use Personal Data and Anonymous Data for market research purposes and to improve our products, the Site, and the Software. We may share Anonymous Data with selected third parties and business partners, however, we will not share any Anonymous Data if such information is, contains, or will be linked to your Personal Data, unless we have given you notice, as described in this Privacy Policy, and you have given us authorization to do so. Redbrick will use Personal Data and IP addresses to identify users of the Site and Software if and when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Site’s policies, or to protect our products, the Software, the Site, or other users of the Site and/or Software.
We may use Personal Data collected from you for the following general purposes:
to fulfill your requests for our Software;
to improve the Site and Software;
to contact you to resolve problems;
to send you information about the Software including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages;
to communicate with you about products and services offered by us and our selected partners;
to engage with third-party service providers so that you can access and use the Software; and
to periodically conduct product and market research regarding your use of the Software.
If and when we use a third-party payment processing merchant, third-party technical support provider, or third-party hosting provider, we ensure that the same privacy criteria, as defined herein, are in place with such third parties. We do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of eighteen.
We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Data. We will periodically send you newsletters and emails that directly promote the use of the Site or the purchase of our Software. When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive, or by contacting us directly (please see contact information below). Should you decide to opt-out of receiving future mailings from us, you may continue to receive future mailings from third parties that you have requested to receive information from. If you do not wish to receive future communications from third-party providers, you should notify them directly of your choice regarding their use of your Personal Data. To opt-out of having future third-party marketing communications sent to you, you will be required to unsubscribe with the applicable third-party providers. Despite your request to no longer receive future newsletters or promotional and marketing communications from us, we reserve the right to continue to send you notices of any updates to the Software, our Terms of Software, and our Privacy Policy.
How We Collect and Use Application Data
“Application Data” refers to data about how you use the Software. The Software may collect certain information from you including, but not limited to: User IP addresses, OS version, OS localization, version of the application, localization of the application, device, bug reports, etc. The Software obtains this information as a result of data being sent to our servers from our software “agent” embedded in the Software or on the website that you are accessing. The Software generates a globally unique identifier (“GUID”) that is stored on your computer to uniquely identify it. The GUID is a randomly generated number; it does not contain any Personal Data. The GUID is stored on your computer and sent with every report generated by the Software. The Software does not, and will not, collect any other Personal Data from your computer(s) without your prior approval. Application Data we collect is primarily used to report application usage and statistics, improve the Software, and track the performance of various marketing initiatives. Application Data may also be used by Redbrick to answer questions that customers have about their use of the Software.
Sharing of Personal Data
We will never sell, trade, or rent any Personal Data, or any Anonymous Data that may contain Personal Data, to any third-party.
In certain special cases, we may disclose Personal Data when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to you, or is otherwise injuring or interfering with our rights, property or operations, other users of the Software, or anyone who could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose your Personal Data and any Application Data when we believe the law requires it, or in response to any demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with criminal investigation, or civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending civil case or administrative investigation.
If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have engaged in conduct that might be considered unlawful, fraudulent, or might harm or damage the reputation or standing of Redbrick with either the general public or with a business partner or potential business partner of Redbrick, we reserve the right to release your Personal Data to such persons or third parties, as we consider necessary, to prevent you from causing injury to, or otherwise injuring or interfering, now or in the future, with our rights, property or operations or otherwise the rights, property or operations of anyone which could be harmed by such conduct.

To access and retrieve your email messages (i) to display a count of unread messages; (ii) to display your unread, read, draft, deleted, archived, sent, and flagged email messages; and (iii) to read, display, retrieve, and download any files attached to your email messages;
To access your Google account(s) in order to send email messages from your account(s) through the Software;
To access and read your Google Drive files when you use certain features of the Software to display, retrieve, and download those files;

Redbrick cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with the collection and storage of any Application Data and Personal Data, including without limitation, any mistakes and security breaches that may happen.
