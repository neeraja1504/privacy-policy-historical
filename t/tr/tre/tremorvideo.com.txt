Introduction

PRIVACY POLICY FOR TREMOR VIDEO DSP SERVICES
Effective Date: June 22, 2018
What does Tremor Video DSP do?
Tremor Video DSP, Inc., a Taptica Company, is an online video advertising software company. Tremor Video DSP’s advertiser customers engage us to display their video ads in streaming content that is featured on websites and applications across the Internet, including content that is viewable on mobile devices, tablets and TVs. Sellers of advertisements utilize our solutions to improve their yield and maximize the value of their video advertising inventory.
How does Tremor Video DSP’s software select the video ads that I see?
Tremor Video DSP’s proprietary ad serving software displays video ads, typically immediately before or during the streaming of featured content on a website or application. The video ad is provided to Tremor Video DSP by an advertiser, and the featured advertising content is shown on the websites and applications of a content provider.
Our advertisers may specify where, when, and in what context they want their video ads to be displayed. These specifications are sometimes called targeting parameters.
Tremor Video DSP uses its proprietary ad serving software to target, select and deliver ads according to the advertisers’ specifications. In order to optimize the delivery of a video ad, Tremor Video DSP’s software collects and analyzes information provided by the website or application publisher, information collected from a website or application user’s computer or device, and information provided by the advertiser, among other sources, which, in turn, is automatically recorded (logged) by the Tremor Video DSP servers. Examples of the types of information we may collect and store in the server logs include: browser type and language, operating system, Internet Protocol address (for example, to identify a user’s general location), page URL and referral URL (the URL that led you to the page featuring our software), website content (e.g., pictures or ads on the website), video player size, video content (such as video title, description, category), how a user interacts with a video (such as how often they start or stop a video), date and time of request, internet service provider, advertising cookies stored on a user’s device. Our advertising partners may also provide us with audience segment data, which is a non-identifiable list of users that our advertising partners believe to be interested in a certain topic or product or are within demographic categories the advertiser would like to reach. When selecting, targeting and delivering ads, Tremor Video DSP does not actively collect, and does not use or store information such as names, email addresses, or contact information that can be used to readily identify an individual.
Tremor Video DSP’s ad serving software may use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to select, target, and measure the effectiveness of the advertisements we serve. We use these technologies to help determine what ads to present so that they may best relate to the possible preferences and interests of users based on information collected across multiple websites that they visit. We call this practice of collecting data about a user’s online activities to deliver advertising targeted to a user’s likely interests “interest-based advertising.”
A “cookie” is generally a small text file that is sent to a user’s computer. Cookies are commonly assigned by online services, such as websites or ad technologies, to recognize a computer or device that they have encountered before. A cookie is associated with a specific site domain, a specific computer, and a specific Internet browser program. Our advertising cookies are not used to gather the user’s name, street address, e-mail address, or telephone number(s).
A “web beacon” is a small piece of code placed on web pages that can be used, among other things, to count the users who visit the web page, or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a user viewing that page.
How does Tremor Video DSP deliver ads to mobile applications?
In the case of advertisements targeted, selected, and delivered to mobile applications, for example, apps on a smartphone, the Tremor Video DSP software collects information provided by the user’s mobile device, including certain unique mobile operating system advertising IDs, such as Apple’s Identifier for Advertising ID (IDFA) or Google’s Android Advertising ID (AAID) to target, select, and deliver advertisements. Other examples of information we may collect to target, select and deliver advertisements may be the type of the mobile device, the device’s IP address, what apps installed on the device are using the Tremor Video DSP services, how the app user interacts with videos within an app using the Tremor Video DSP services, and the location of a mobile device if a user enables collection of location data for the app using Tremor Video DSP services through the available features on that mobile device.
How does Tremor Video DSP recognize a user across multiple devices?
Tremor Video DSP’s software may, in some cases, be able to infer within a reasonable probability that a particular computer or device may be correlated with the same Tremor Video DSP identifier (e.g., cookie, advertising IDs, IP address) that we have previously associated to another computer or device. In such cases, Tremor Video DSP’s software may be able to infer that a device (e.g . a computer) and another device (e.g. a smartphone) are used by the same user. Where such an inference can be made, we may use this information to target, select and deliver ads across multiple computers and devices. This is sometimes referred to as cross-device advertising.
What are examples of ad choices Tremor Video DSP offers to users?
Opt out of Tremor Video DSP’s cookie used for interest-based advertising by clicking on the “Opt Out” button at the top of this page. Your web browser will need to accept cookies for the opt-out to be effective.

You will need to opt out separately for each browser and each device. There is not a single opt out that governs all your browsers and devices.
If you change your browser or device, you will need to opt out again for each new browser and device. The new browser and device does not inherit your prior settings.
If you delete the opt out cookie from your browser, you will need to opt out again from that browser.

Our services do not respond to browser Do Not Track signals. To opt out of Tremor Video DSP’s cookie used for interest-based advertising by clicking on the “Opt Out” button at the top of this page. For more information about Do Not Track signals, please visit www.allaboutdnt.com.
How do we use third-party service providers?
Tremor Video DSP and its advertisers may use third-party ad service providers to help deliver advertisements. These ad service providers use cookies, web beacons, or other technologies to select, target, deliver, and measure the effectiveness of advertisements, including when determining what ads to present so that they may best relate to the possible preferences and interests of users. Tremor Video DSP may use data that ad service providers collect in the delivery of interest-based advertisements.
Tremor Video DSP may share non-personally identifiable information about users gathered by means of cookies, web beacons, or other technologies, including anonymous identifiers used in connection with mobile applications, with certain ad service providers so that they can help Tremor Video DSP deliver more relevant advertisements, including for cross - device advertising. The use of cookies, web beacons, or other technologies by other ad service providers is subject to their respective privacy policies, and not by the privacy policy of Tremor Video DSP. You can find out more about ad service providers and the choices you have about their technologies by clicking on the links at the bottom of this privacy policy. Similarly, the publishers (such as websites and mobile applications) to which we deliver an ad are subject to their own privacy policies and not the privacy policy of Tremor Video DSP.
Is information transferred to Tremor Video DSP and affiliates?
Tremor Video DSP may transfer or assign the information it collects in connection with its business to any successor-in-interest to Tremor Video DSP (such as a company that acquires Tremor Video DSP), or internally to one or more affiliates (such as a corporate subsidiary, an affiliate company, or parent). Tremor Video DSP may also disclose information if it determines that an applicable law, regulation, or legal process requires it, or if Tremor Video DSP determines that it needs to share such information to protect or enforce Tremor Video DSP’s rights or the rights of our customers or another user.
Security
We have taken steps to help protect the information we collect through Tremor Video DSP’s advertising services from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We take measures to protect information we share with third parties. However, no data security measures can guarantee security.
