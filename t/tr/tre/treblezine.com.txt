User privacy is very important to Treblezine.com. Any user's information gathered by us will be kept confidential and will not be sold or released to other agencies. This information will not be used to generate SPAM or unsolicited bulk email.
We may collect certain information from readers in order to have access to certain features, such as our forum. We may log users' IP addresses, email addresses or passwords when such users voluntarily create an account on the forum or to access other features that would require registration. This information will not be shared with outside parties.
Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising, and we sometimes permit our advertising and promotional partners to call to your attention products, special offers and unique content we believe might be of interest to you. We offer you the opportunity to elect not to receive direct communications sent by our advertisers or promotional partners, as described below.
Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.
Treblezine.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. Treblezine.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.
Treblezine.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information was collected.
Feel free to contact us if you have any questions, comments or suggestions regarding our privacy policy.
