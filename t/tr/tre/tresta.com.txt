Tresta will never sell your personal information to others. We will share it when needed to support your account or run our own analytics, but not so others can try and sell you their stuff too.

We will treat your personal information as confidential, and we will not share it with third parties without your permission, except in the limited circumstances described below.
We may provide your personal information to third parties for purposes of billing, charging your credit card, and determining the applicable taxes and regulatory fees that may apply to your services.

Protection of Personal Information
Basically the Lawyers Are Saying:
We try very hard to protect your personal information by keeping up with current standards of security, but you should know – nothing over the internet is 100% guaranteed safe.
Protection of Personal Information
The security of your personal information is important to us. We do not store customer credit card account information. Credit card account numbers are encrypted and stored by a third party that specializes in the collection and maintenance of credit card information. All personal information, other than credit card numbers, is stored in a protected database that is accessible by a limited number of Tresta employees. All servers that store customer data have undergone a process known as "security hardening" to improve security and reduce the vulnerability of data stored on the servers consistent with best practices and National Security Agency guidelines. Customer data may be stored in data centers provided by third parties. All third-party data centers are compliant with current industry standards. While we follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is one hundred percent secure and we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Please contact us if you have any questions about the security of our services.

We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you services and after the termination of your account for analytical purposes and/or to reactivate your account if you elect to do so.
