such information), as well as through the Websites, the Platform, and other similar
channels. By providing us with your contact information you consent to our use of
such contract information to send you such notices, and any notices required by law.
You may notify us at any time if you do not wish us to send you promotional

Personally Identifying Information
The information you provide us will include Personally Identifying Information
("PII") which is information that can be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate
or otherwise identify you.
We do not collect PII except when provided voluntarily by you directly. We do not
rent, sell or disseminate PII to third parties without your consent, other than:
disclosure to our employees, consultants, contractors, business partners, clients,
service providers and suppliers. Such disclosure is normally subject to the recipient's
undertaking of confidentiality obligations and the prevention of any independent right
to use this information by the recipients, except as required to help us provide the
Website and the Platform.
to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to respond to a subpoena, search
warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, whether or not a response
is required by applicable law;
to enforce an agreement or to protect our rights;
with any of our parent, or affiliated or successor entity;
to consummate, and as part of, any asset sale, transfer, merger or liquidation;
We only provide data to our advertising partners after we have removed your name or
any other personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other
people's data in a way that it is no longer associated with you. As stated above, we
may allow third-party advertising agencies and networks to serve advertisements, or
may ourselves serve advertisements, through the Websites and/or Platform. Such ads
may be based on the information provided to us, other than the PII. We do not provide
any PII to such advertising agencies and networks. However, please note that if an
advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain type of users or audience, and
you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you
fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. You should consult the
respective privacy policies of advertising agencies and networks. This Policy does not
apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Any
solicitation of personal information through such advertisements is strictly between
the advertiser and you.
You may choose voluntarily whether or not to provide us with your PII. Notices
provided at the Platform and the Websites where we collect PII should help you to
make this choice. If you choose to avoid provision of your PII as we request it, you
may be unable to access and use certain options, offers and services available through
the Websites and/or Platform and/or that involve our interaction with you. You may
request access to all your voluntarily-provided PII that we collected online and
maintain in our database by sending a written request to info@treepodia.com.
Deactivation and Deletion of Your Information
If you want to delete or remove your PII stored with us permanently, you may send an
e-mail to unsubscribe@treepodia.com. Please include "Delete my Information" in the
subject line and your full name and e-mail address in the body of the e-mail. We will
respond to your request in a timely manner, normally within thirty (30) days. Upon
such request, we will make our best efforts to remove all your PII from our database.
However, please note that some information may not be deleted from all databases
and backup records. We may also retain certain PII for client and user service, legal
and similar purposes. We reserve the right to keep all non-PII and continue to use
such non-PII in accordance with this Policy after the deletion of all your PII.
Information Security
We use industry standard measures to ensure the security of all information, including
the use of passwords, firewalls, encryption and remote servers, and routinely evaluate
our practices to identify security threats or opportunities for the improvement of our
Website and Platform.
However, no transmission of information is guaranteed to be completely secure.
Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may
compromise information security. You acknowledge and agree to assume this
risk when using the Websites and Platform and/or when communicating with us.

age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to use the Websites and Platform. If you
are under 13, please do not use any of the Websites and Platform and do not send any
