For Tresorit, security and data privacy are of paramount importance. This Privacy Policy describes our commitment to protect the privacy of individuals in accordance with the GDPR.
The main content on the left contains the legally binding full-length version. To help you understand our Privacy Policy better, we collected some helpful notes on the right to sum up the key points of the main content.
Our Data Privacy Commitment
In a nutshell
Our mission is to make privacy and security available to people and businesses. That’s why we use end-to-end encryption to protect files and folders you share and store in the cloud.
We encrypt all and every transmission containing personal data using Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL) and apply additional, client-side encryption on the files and directories uploaded and stored in protected storage folders (the Encrypted Content).
We never collect or store your files, encryption keys and passwords in an unencrypted or invertible form. The Encrypted Content and corresponding encryption keys can only be decrypted by you and persons with whom you explicitly share them. However, if you have an account that is part of a Business Subscription with recovery master key, Your Encrypted Content may also be accessed by your Recovery Administrator.
According to the best of Tresorit’s knowledge, the current state of the art and the public knowledge of the human race, Tresorit is unable to decrypt the Encrypted Content and accordingly, Tresorit cannot access it. As a result, we cannot use Your Encrypted Content to identify any individual.
However, when using the service, creating and using your user account, you also submit some non-encrypted data, which may include personal data as well.
Even though we can’t read or access the files and folders you store in Tresorit, we need to process some of your personal data to provide you with services.

Who will process your personal data?
Tresorit services are provided by Tresorit AG (company registration no: CH-300.3.017.920-5; address: Minervastrasse 3, 8032 Zurich) (Tresorit), a company registered under the laws of Switzerland. If you have a subscription with Tresorit as an individual user, Tresorit will be the controller of your personal data under EU law.
Your data is processed by Tresorit. However, if you are a part of a business subscription, certain data is processed upon the instructions of your organization.
If your account is part of a Business Subscription – in accordance with section 5 of our Terms or you receive a Tresorit link from a user who is part of a Business Subscription, in certain cases, the ultimate decisions regarding your personal data will be made by the relevant organisation. In such case, your company will be considered as a controller and Tresorit will act as a processor, acting upon the instructions of such organisation.
In any case, certain activites of Tresorit are outsourced to third parties (processors), they may also use your personal data when acting on behalf of Tresorit. You can find more details about our sub-processors here.
What kind of personal data do we process?
A) Data that you provide to us
Registration information. When you register for our services, you submit some non-encrypted identification and contact data (such as your e-mail address, name, job title or position, address, phone number). The data that we request at the time of registration is necessary for the provision of our services.
Certain basic information, like your name and email address, is necessary for setting up a Tresorit account.
Billing information. At the time of registration, you also need to provide certain billing information. You might also provide payment information, such as payment card details, which we collect via secure payment processing services. This data is necessary to provide you with Tresorit services.
When you purchase a subscription, you also need to provide payment information, which will be handled by secure processing services.
Account information. When you use our services, you also give us access to certain information (such as the name and the permission history of your Tresorit Folders) that is necessary for the provision and maintenance of your user account. For the avoidance of any doubt, Tresorit cannot connect such metadata information to Your Encrypted Content or file names as Tresorit has no access to the Encrypted Content or file names.
In order to send and deliver invitations upon your instructions, Tresorit stores and accesses certain personal data (such as the email address, name, Tresor name and its unique URL, storage account and username of the inviter and the invited person). Please note that your email address, first and last name are visible to others when you send them an invitation to, or if you accept an invitation.
Some information about your Tresorit Folders is unencrypted, like its name, size and members. This is needed for features like your activity wall.
Access logs. Content owners may apply certain security settings to protect the content of share links. If you open a Tresorit link where Detailed access logs are enabled, certain information (such as your IP address, approx. location, and the platforms that were used to download the contents of the link) will be logged for your open attempts.
Tresorit users may also require an email verification before you can download the content they shared with you. If you are signed in to Web Access, the email address associated with your account will be used by default for such purposes. Otherwise, the email you use for verification will be logged.
Please note that, the above information will be visible to the sender of the link and other users who have rights to share that specific file or folder. If you have any questions about this, please refer to the policies of the relevant Business Domain.
When sharing content, Tresorit users can enable access logs or request an email verification from those who wish to download their content. In these cases certain information about you will be logged and shared with the content’s owners.
Other information. You may decide to share further information, including personal data, with us when you contact our Support or Sales Teams, submit forms on our website or otherwise communicate with us. It is solely your decision to share any detailed, non-aggregated logs (which may contain e.g. non-encrypted filenames), your screen or any other data with us during such communications, so our processing of such data will be based on your consent.
Sometimes, when you require assistance from our Sales and Support teams, you may choose to share additional information with us.
