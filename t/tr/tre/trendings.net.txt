Privacy Policy | Trendings
Your privacy on Trendings The technology driving websites is evolving quickly – much faster than most users’ knowledge of what is going on behind the scenes.
As a matter of course, every web site is constantly collecting information about how its pages are being used. At a basic level, web servers record all activity in log files, while statistical analysis programers gather aggregated information to help publishers understand how their sites are being used. And when you register with sites your email address and other information you may supply is stored securely for specific reasons, such as sending you newsletters.
Different users will have different levels of interaction with Trendings.
You may simply browse our content – read our articles, peruse our galleries, and so on – without actively giving us any information about yourself. You may register your email address so that you can receive our editors’ weekly news roundups, and other updates and offers. As an author you may register your email address so that you can contribute to the content on the site.
