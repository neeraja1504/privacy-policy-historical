A. INTRODUCTION
Definitions
"Personally identifiable information" is information, that is not otherwise publicly available, which can be used to distinguish or trace your identity, such as your name, phone number, email address, credit card number, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to you, such as date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, etc.
"TREND websites" includes all areas (public and private) of TREND's website, www.trendmls.com, and all areas of our Membership, MLS and Public Records (Realty Records) databases.
A "Cookie" is a small amount of data, often including an anonymous unique identifier, transmitted to your browser from a website, which includes electronic data about you and your computer. "Cookies" are stored on your computer's hard drive.
Notification of Changes
This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to TREND's products and services, TREND websites , or as we incorporate suggestions from you.
We will post the amended Privacy Policy prominently on our website so that you can always review what personally identifiable information we gather, how we might use that personally identifiable information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
The TREND websites includes links to some third party websites. These sites are governed by their own privacy statements, and TREND is not responsible for their operations, including but not limited to their information practices. If you submit personally identifiable information to or through these third party websites, you should review the privacy statement of these sites before providing them with personally identifiable information.
B. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Listing Data and Images
The nature of TREND's business is the gathering and sharing of data to facilitate real estate transactions, between member real estate professionals. When you enter a listing into the MLS system, the content and images associated with that listing become part of the copyrighted MLS listing database compilation. The use of the content and images is governed by TREND's Rules and Regulations. Use the link at the bottom of the page for a copy of TREND's Rules and Regulations.
The use of the public records content in Realty Records is governed by the Realty Records license agreement, which you must agree to in order to obtain access to that system.
The use of Bing maps is also governed by Microsoft's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.
Required Information ("My Profile")
To become a TREND member, you must provide a variety of personally identifiable information , including but not limited to your name, address, phone number and email address.
Optional Information
If you choose to purchase optional products you may be asked to provide additional personally identifiable information about yourself. If you utilize optional features offered from TREND, such as E-Cards or flyers in TREND's MLS system, you may submit, at your option, additional personally identifiable information (like personal photos) for optimum use of that service. TREND may also collect similar personally identifiable information if you apply for a TREND job or enter a TREND contest.
Transaction Information
When you use TREND to pay your invoice, we ask you to provide information related to each transaction, including the amount of the transaction, the particular invoice you wish to apply payment to, and your email address. We retain this information for each of your transactions through TREND. We also collect the Internet address (IP address) of the computer or device you use to access your TREND account.
Website Traffic Data
Because of the way that World Wide Web communication standards work, when you arrive at or leave TREND websites, we automatically receive the web address of the site that you came from or are going to. We also collect statistics on which pages of our website you visit while you are on TREND's websites, the type of browser you use and the times you access our websites. We use this data only to try to understand your preferences better and to manage the load on our servers, so as to improve our service and your experience with TREND.
Our Use of "Cookies"
"Cookies" are small files of data that we send to your computer to allow us to recognize you as a TREND customer if you return a TREND site using the same computer and browser. We send a "session cookie" to your computer when you log in to TREND by entering your username and password. These cookies allow us to recognize you if you visit our various sites during the same session, so that you don't need to re-enter your password multiple times. They also track the functions you performed and collect anonymous traffic data while on our site. Once you log out or close your browser, these session cookies expire and no longer have any effect.
Support Center Correspondence
If you send us correspondence, including emails and faxes, we may retain such correspondence in the records of your account. We may also retain Support Center correspondence and other correspondence from TREND to you. We may retain some of these records in order to measure and improve our member service, and to investigate violations of our Rules and Regulations. We may, over time, delete these records.
Questionnaires and Surveys
From time to time, we may offer optional questionnaires and surveys to you for such purposes as collecting demographic statistics or assessing your interests and needs. The use of the data collected will be explained in detail in the survey itself. If we collect personally identifiable information from our members in these questionnaires and surveys, the members will be given notice of how the personally identifiable information will be used prior to their participation in the survey or questionnaire.
Non-member (REALTORÂ® to customer) Personally Identifiable Information and Communications
You have the option to create customer and/or client contact information in the MLS system, which by its nature contains personally identifiable information on an individual who is not a TREND member TREND will not use customer/client personally identifiable information or disclose that personally identifiable information to third parties.
When you send an email through TREND's MLS system to a customer or client, we retain a copy of that email, including, for example, the recipient's name and email address. We do this so you can see a complete record of your communications for the past 180 days. Although this personally identifiable information is stored, we will not market to the non-member in any way at any time. TREND will not disclose any customer or client personally identifiable information to third parties.
When you send an email through TREND's MLS system to a customer or client, that customer or client must choose to subscribe or unsubscribe from receiving emails from you. TREND will not share the customer's or client's choice to subscribe or unsubscribe with any TREND member, other than the member who initiated the request. TREND does, however, reserve the right to share all customers' subscription choices with any ISP (AOL, MSN, Yahoo!, etc.) if necessary to establish the legitimacy of TREND's MLS email.
C. OUR USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

This is done in order to verify your application and your standing in the Association, which may directly affect your type of TREND membership. These Associations may use this personally identifiable information to market other products and services which may be of interest to you.
We license content related to the advertisement and showing of properties on www.REALTOR.com and other publicly viewed websites such as www.philly.com, www.courierpostonline.com and www.delawareonline.com.

In order to deliver certain services to members, our service providers may have access to your personally identifiable information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities to ensure optimum use of the service. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personally identifiable information , we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the TREND-specified purposes.
We share aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our members live in a particular county. However, these aggregated statistical data is not tied to personally identifiable information.
Legal Disclosures
We will disclose personally identifiable information that we in good faith believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Rules and Regulations. Specifically, this means that if we conduct a violations investigation, and conclude that one side may have engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's personally identifiable information (but not bank account or credit card numbers) to parties who request it.
We will disclose personally identifiable information in response to a validly issued subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action.
We will disclose personally identifiable information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
As with any other business, it is possible that TREND in the future could merge with another company. If this occurs, the successor company would have access to the personally identifiable information maintained by TREND, including member account information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended as described in Section A above.
Our Contacts with TREND Members
We communicate with you on a regular basis via email to provide requested services, and we also communicate by phone to resolve complaints or investigate suspicious transactions. We use your email address to send you bills and notices of due dates, to send notices about important changes to our products and services, service announcements, confirmations of orders placed online, responses to member requests and to send notices and other disclosures required by law. Generally, you cannot opt out of these communications, but they will be primarily educational in nature rather than promotional.
We also use your email address to send you other types of promotional communications, including the TRENDLink newsletter, member surveys and notices of special third-party promotions. You can choose whether or not to receive these communications when you complete the registration process, or at any time thereafter, by changing your preferences in the "Member Login Information" section of "My Profile". You can change your choices at any time.
In connection with independent audits of our financial statements and operations, the auditors may seek to contact a sample of our members to confirm that our records are accurate. However, these auditors cannot use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
Internet Address Information We use IP addresses, browser types and access times to analyze trends, administer the site, improve site performance and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
D. INFORMATION SECURITY
TREND is committed to handling your personally identifiable information with high standards of security. We restrict access to your personally identifiable information to employees who need to know that personally identifiable information in order to provide products or services to you or to perform their jobs. We enforce physical and electronic measures to guard your non-public personally identifiable information.
The security of your TREND account also relies on your protection of your TREND password. We require that you never share your TREND password with anyone. If you do share your TREND password with a third party for any reason, (other than by someone authorized by TREND's rules) you will be in violation of TREND's Rules and Regulations; the third party will have access to your account and your personally identifiable information , and you may be responsible for actions taken using your password. If you believe someone else has obtained access to your password, please log in to TREND, change your password in My Profile, and contact us right away as described below.
TREND uses security questions to better verify your identity and better protect your sensitive information. The answers you provide will help in the authentication process if you should forget your login information. Additionally, TREND collects forensic access data on login sessions including, but not limited to, keystroke dynamics, locations, time of day, devices, browsers, operating systems, and networks in order to further protect your password, ensure that your login credentials are validated, and secure your sensitive information.
Data Security and Encryption
The security of your personally identifiable information , is the core of our business and a top priority at TREND. When paying fees in "Billing andTraining," TREND automatically encrypts your personally identifiable information in transit from your computer to ours using the Transport Layer Security protocol (TLS) with an encryption key length of 128-bits. Other pages where sensitive information is transferred and SSL is used include the Login page, Homepage and specific "My Profile" pages. Before you enter "Billing and Training," our server checks that you're using an approved browser - one that uses TLS 1.1 or higher.
The answers to the security questions you answered will be stored in My Profile. These answers will be one-way encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.
Once your personally identifiable information reaches us, it resides on a server that is heavily guarded both physically and electronically. Our servers sit behind an electronic firewall, so your personally identifiable information is available only to authorized computers.
TREND also uses a technique called "seeding" whereby we add personally identifiable information on artificial members into our member database. Should someone use member personally identifiable information for purposes not in accordance with our Rules and Regulations, TREND staff will be notified and appropriate action will be taken.
E. ACCESSING AND CHANGING YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
You can review the personally identifiable information you provided us and make any desired changes to such personally identifiable information , or to the settings for your TREND account, at any time by logging in and changing your personally identifiable information in "My Profile."
If/When you are no longer a TREND member, we will mark your account in our database as "Terminated," but will retain your personally identifiable information in our database.
