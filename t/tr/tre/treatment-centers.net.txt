CLIENT/ PATIENT RIGHTS POLICY
Although we are not a treatment center ourselves, Treatment-Centers.net strives to adhere to the high standards set forth for drug/alcohol treatment programs which stipulate the following regulations.  In accordance with prevailing state and national licensing and accreditation standards, each participant receiving services from an alcohol and/or drug program shall have rights which include, but are not limited to, the following:
The right to confidentiality as provided for in Title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 2; and Title 45, Parts 160 & 164.
To be accorded dignity in contact with staff.
To be accorded a safe, healthful group environment.
To be free from verbal, emotional, physical abuse, and/or inappropriate sexual behavior.
To be informed by the program of the procedures to file a grievance or appeal a discharge from program.
To be free from discrimination based on: ethnic or gender group identification, religion, age, sex, color or any type of disability.
To be accorded access to review of his/her health records, have an opportunity to request a correction to the record, if appropriate; and to receive a copy of the record within 30 days of a written request.
To express personal preference regarding case manager, counselor or any other service personnel.
To be free to attend religious services or activities of his or her choice and to have visits from a spiritual advisor-- provided that these services or activities do not conflict with facility program requirements. Participation in religious services will be voluntary only.
Any complaints regarding violation of client rights should be directed to that pertinent state department for alcohol and drug treatment licensure. See State Substance Abuse Agencies for further information.
NONDISCRIMINATION POLICY
Treatment-Centers.net Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center affiliated programs do not discriminate in the provision of services on the basis of ethnic group identification, religion, age, sex, color or disability, pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Section 2000d, Title 42, United States Code), the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 794, Title 29, United States Code); the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Section 12132, Title 42, United States Code); and per relevant State regulations wherein a Treatment-Centers.net Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center operates.
ACCESSIBILITY POLICY
Each Treatment-Centers.net Drug and Alcohol Treatment program maintains an ongoing policy and plan of accessibility, which conforms to federal and state requirements. It is Treatment-Centers.net's goal to have all of its services accessible to those individuals meeting the admission criteria. Each referral from Treatment-Centers.net will strive to provide certain program accessibility plans in attempts to cover the following potential barriers:
Attitudinal
Architectural
Environmental
Financial
Employment
Communication
Transportation
Any other barriers, as these become identified.
Reasonable accommodations are provided, as needed, to enable qualified individuals to access a program’s operations and services. For more information, contact the particular facility’s intake department.
BILLING & PAYMENT POLICY
The client/patient and/or financial guarantor obligates himself/herself to pay the Treatment-Centers.net Drug and Alcohol Treatment Program Facility in accordance with the agreed rates and terms, notwithstanding the assignment of health coverage (call the intake department regarding treatment rates, expected deductibles and co-pays). Pharmacy/prescriptions may also need separate insurance coverage and/or payment arrangements.
INSURANCE RESPONSIBILITY
The client/patient must understand that it is the sole responsibility of the subscriber/guarantor to know what his/her insurance benefits are, and if the policy is in effect. The program's business office will make every effort to verify the insurance and to obtain the benefits from the insurance company. No employee or anyone affiliated with Treatment-Centers.net Drug and Alcohol Treatment Program will, or can be held responsible for knowing what a client's insurance will or will not cover. This includes benefits that may have been quoted by the insurance company.
The business office will bill your insurance as a courtesy to you and make every effort to obtain payment. However, all or any portion of the bill that is not paid by the insurance carrier is the sole responsibility of the client and/or the guarantor. Benefits that are quoted by the insurance company may only reflect coverage charges and not 100% of the billed charges. Benefit quotations are subject to the member's eligibility at the time benefits were requested and any quotations are not a guarantee of benefit coverage or of member eligibility until actual insurance payment for services is received. All anticipated uninsured/non-covered charges and projected co-payments are expected to be paid upon admission. No interest will accrue to current accounts. Any and all unpaid portions of an account may be referred to a collection agency at thirty (30) days past due. If referred to collections, all interest and legal fees will be the responsibility of the debtor/guarantor.

The patient consents in writing.
The disclosure is allowed by a court order.
The disclosure is made to medical personnel in a medical emergency or to designated and qualified staff for research, audit, or program evaluation.
