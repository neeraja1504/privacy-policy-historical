4. HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We’ll only use your personal data when we’re allowed to by law and only for the reasons we collected it. Some of those reasons are performing a contract with you, when it’s necessary for our legitimate interests (and your interests and rights don’t override ours), and when we need to comply with legal or regulatory obligations. We’ll only use your personal data for the reasons we collected it, though we may use it for compatible purposes if we reasonably think we need to do so. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain our reasons for doing so.
Here’s how we use the personal data that we collect:
We use your Identity, Contact, Profile, Usage, Marketing and Communications, and Technical Data to deliver relevant marketing content to you and measure and understand its effectiveness. This is necessary for our legitimate interests, like studying how customers use our products and services so we can develop our marketing strategies and grow our business.
We use your Usage and Technical Data to perform data analytics that help us improve our sites, products and services, marketing, customer relationships and experiences. This is necessary for our legitimate interests in defining the types of customers for our products and services, keeping our website updated and relevant, developing marketing strategies and growing our business.
We use your Identity, Contact, Profile, and Marketing and Communications Data to manage our relationship with you, including notifying you about changes to our terms or privacy policies or asking you to take a survey or provide feedback. This is necessary to comply with our legal obligations and for our legitimate interests in keeping our records updated and studying how customers use our products and services to develop our marketing strategies and grow our business.
We use your Identity, Contact, and Technical Data to administer and protect our business and this website, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, system maintenance, support, reporting and hosting of data. This is necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations and for our legitimate interests in running our business, providing administration and IT services, maintaining the security of our network and preventing fraud, and in the event of a reorganization or restructuring.
We use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to make suggestions and recommendations to you about products or services that may be of interest to you. This is necessary for our legitimate interest in developing our products and services, refining our marketing strategies, and growing our business.
We’ll send you marketing communications if you’ve requested information from us (including registering for a webinar, downloading content or asking for a demo) or purchased our products or services, unless you’ve opted out of receiving our marketing. If you want to opt out of communications from us or our third parties, follow the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or contact us at marketing-admin@cision.com. Even if you opt out, we may still use your personal data and contact you if you’re a customer.
5. COOKIES
We use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies on our sites to distinguish you from other visitors, analyze trends, administer our sites, track usage, and gather demographic information about our visitors. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent from a web server and stored on your device. Third parties (like advertising networks and web traffic analyzers) may also use cookies on our sites, over which we have no control. You can block cookies using the settings on your browser. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies you may not be able to access all or parts of our site. By continuing to browse our site, you are agreeing to our use of cookies.
6. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We may have to share your personal data with Internal Third Parties, External Third Parties, or third parties as part of a merger, acquisition or similar corporate transaction. All third parties that we share your personal data with are expected to respect your personal data and treat it in accordance with applicable law. We only allow third party service providers to process your personal data for specific purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
7. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
If you’re in the European Economic Area (EEA), we transfer your data outside the EEA. When we do, we make sure your personal data is protected. For some service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, click here. For service providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For more information about Privacy Shield, click here.
8. DATA SECURITY
We have appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards in place to keep your personal information from wandering out of our control or being inappropriately accessed. This includes limiting access to your personal data and giving specific instructions on how to use your personal data. If we suspect your personal data has gone astray, we’ll let you know as soon as possible and notify any applicable regulator where we are legally required to do so.
9. DATA RETENTION
We keep your personal data only as long as we need it to achieve the purposes for which we collected it. When deciding how long to keep your data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the data, the potential risk of harm if it’s accessed or used inappropriately, the purposes for which we collect and process it and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and any applicable legal requirements.
10. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You can exercise any of your rights by contacting us at privacy@cision.com. We may need to ask you for specific information to confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data or exercise your other rights. If you’re in the EEA:
You can request access to your personal data to receive a copy of the personal data we hold.
You can request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.
You can request erasure of your personal data, though we may not be able to comply with your request if we have specific legal reasons (if that’s the case, we’ll let you know as soon as possible).
You can object to us processing your personal data, though we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your interests (such as performance of a contract with you).
You can request restrictions on processing your personal data.
You can request the transfer of your personal data that was automatically collected with your consent or used to perform a contract with you, in which case we’ll provide your data in a structured, commonly-used, machine-readable format.
You can withdraw consent at any time for personal data for which we are relying on your consent to process, though this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing that was carried out before you withdrew your consent.
