SECURITY
The security of your personal information is very important to us. We utilize commercially reasonable information security standards to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. TTG supports online security using appropriately secure technology because we want your data to be safe. We bind our employees and data processors to written agreements to observe your privacy and confidentiality rights. Unfortunately, no method of internet transmission is one hundred percent secure. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its security.
DURATION AND RETENTION
TTG will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy, or as required or permitted by law, and then will delete it as required by law. For example, TTG will retain your information as long as required to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws, cybersecurity and privacy laws, laws and regulations that affect the conduct of our business; to resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, cooperate with law enforcement requests or to meet other legal obligations. We may also retain log files for internal analysis purposes, though we would retain them for only a brief period except in cases where we are legally required to retain them for longer periods, and in cases where they are used for site safety and security or to improve website functionality.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
TTG operates on a global basis. By using our products and services you understand and agree that your personal information may be transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA, which comprises the European Union countries plus Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein) to a country which does not have an equivalent level of data protection. When your personal information is transferred from your home country to another country, the laws and regulations that protect your personal information may be different than those in your home country.
UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. If we do, we will change the “effective date” at the top of the Privacy Policy. Before making any update that would make this Privacy Policy materially less restrictive in our use or disclosure of personal information collected prior to the update, we will provide prior notice of the update by posting notice on our Website at the top of the then-current Privacy Policy within a reasonable time before the effective date of the update. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information.
