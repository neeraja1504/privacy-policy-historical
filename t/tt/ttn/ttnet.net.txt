Limitation of Liability
As long as this website receives the data you send, it will take greatest efforts to ensure the security of the data storage in our system. However due to the openness of the Internet, even though the website is committed to protecting user data, it still can not completely guarantee the data you transmit or send is absolutely safe.
Please note: This site links with other sites; manufacturers who have posted information on these websites may also collect your data, but they are not necessarily the same policy as ours to protect your privacy. When you click on information results of or participate in their joint activities with this site, if you have questions concerning their way of using your information, please contact them directly. Because that website does not monitor user activity, and that website does not have a privacy policy for individual users, this site's privacy statement is not applicable, so we are not responsible for data collection activities of users on that site.
