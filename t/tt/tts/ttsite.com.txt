Tuya Smart Inc. ('Tuya Smart', 'we' or 'us') recognizes that your privacy is important and we take it seriously. This Privacy Policy describes the collection, use and disclosure of your information when you access or use (a) our websites (including www.tuya.com, iot.tuya.com and any dashboards or portals that we make available to our customers, users and others) (collectively, the 'Sites'), (b) software (such as apps, reference tools, libraries and widgets) that we make available (the 'Software') which may be installed on your phone, tablet, wireless device, computer or server ('Device'), and/or (c) the Tuya Smart Cloud. The Sites, Software, Tuya Smart Cloud and any services we provide in connection with one or more of the foregoing are collectively referred to as the 'Services'. This Privacy Policy also applies to information that may be transmitted to us by our customers through software provided by them or other third parties ('Third Party Software'), through Activated Machines (described below) or through other means. This Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties collect, use, disclose or retain information.
This Privacy Policy sets out how we may collect, use, transfer, retain, secure and disclose your personal data and/or personal data about your customers or end users that you provide to us pursuant to your use of the Tuya Smart Cloud Platform and/or our Cloud Services, as well as other terms relating to data location. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal data. By accessing the Tuya Smart Cloud Platform or using the Cloud Services, you consent to the collection, use, transfer, retention and disclosure of such personal data in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and agree to accept and be bound by the terms herein.
Many of our Cloud Services offered through the Tuya Smart Cloud Platform are intended for use by business organisations. You acknowledge and agree that if you use your organisation’s email address to register an account and purchase or use our Cloud Services, the owner of the domain associated with your organisation’s email address, and/or your organisation, may monitor or control your account with the Tuya Smart Cloud Platform and access, process, and/or control your personal data, as well as the contents of your communications and files. You acknowledge and agree that your organisation’s use of our Cloud Services may be subject to your organisation’s own rules or policies, and you shall direct all privacy enquiries relating to such rules or policies to your organisation’s administrators. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of your organisation.
1. Information We Collect.
a. Personal Information. We collect both personal information and non-personal information. Personal information identifies you or another person as an individual and includes such items as your name, address, phone number and email address. We collect personal information through your use and interaction with our Services, such as you when you transmit communications through the Software, Sites or Third Party Software, when you register for an account with us, when you post messages and content through the Software, Sites or Third Party Software, when you send us an email or other communication, or when you transmit to us personal information through the Tuya Smart Cloud, through an Activated Machine or through other means. Also, personal information may be collected automatically through the Software, Third Party Software and directly from an Activated Machine to the Tuya Smart Cloud. Please be aware that certain Software installed on your Device may access other files on your Device, such as your contacts, photographs, audio and video clips and your contact information. If you activate your machine through Third Party Software, personal information may be transmitted to us by such Third Party Software in addition to, or instead of, directly through your Activated Machine. Please be aware that the collection, use, disclosure, retention and other practices of any third party who collects your information is subject to the privacy policy of such third party, which we do not control. If you are a customer of Tuya Smart (such as a manufacturer of machines which are enabled to be activated on the Tuya Smart Cloud), we collect personal information (about you and your end users) that you transmit to us through Third Party Software, Activated Machines, data feeds or other methods agreed by you and Tuya Smart.
b. Non-Personal Information. Non-personal information does not personally identify you or another person as an individual and includes such items as aggregated information, demographic information and any other information that does not reveal your or another individual's specific identity. We and our third party service providers may collect non-personal information from you, your Activated Machine, the Software, Third Party Software, and other means. Non-personal information includes the following: (a) the unique device ID number of your Device ('UDID'), the MAC address of your Activated Machine and the IP address of your Device; (b) the wireless connection information of your Activated Machine; (c) OS type and version, browser type and version, push notice identifier, and mobile network information of your Device; (d) traffic data, location data, logs, communication data, and data about the resources you use through the Software, Sites or Third Party Software; (e) real-time location information about your Device and Activated Machine; (f) usage, performance and diagnostic information about your Activated Machine; (g) information that has been aggregated in a manner such that it does not personally identify you or any other individual; and (h) metadata and other information associated with other files stored on your Device, such as photographs, audio and video clips, personal contacts and address book information.
c. Cookies and Other Technologies. When you visit the Sites, we may send one or more 'cookies,' which are small data files, to your Device to uniquely identify your browser and let us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Sites. If you use Third Party Software, the provider thereof may send one or more cookies to your Device. Cookies help us measure, for example, the total number of visitors to our Sites, the number of visitors to each page of our Sites, how our users use and interact with the Services, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. If you do not want cookies to be installed on your Device, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies. Please be aware that some features of the Sites and Services will not function properly if the ability of your Device to accept cookies is disabled.
d. We may also use web beacons to track usage patterns of users of the Services. Additionally, we may use HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting and make the Services better for our users.
e. IP Address and UDID. Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device by your Internet service provider, your UDID (or similar ID) is the unique identification number associated with your Device, and your MAC address is the unique number assigned to your machine. Your IP address, UDID and/or MAC address are identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Sites, use the Software or Third Party Software to connect to the Tuya Smart Cloud, or when your Activated Machine communicates with the Tuya Smart Cloud, along with the time(s) of such visit(s), the page(s) on the Sites that were visited, the features within the Software and Tuya Smart Cloud that were accessed and used. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites. Please note that we treat IP addresses, UDIDs, MAC addresses, server log files and related information as non-personal information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.
f. Tracking. We honor do-not-track signals or similar technologies that our systems detect and identify. We do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when such do-not-track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place on your Device.
