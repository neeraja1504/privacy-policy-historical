TTC Privacy Policy

provide sufficient detail to enable an experienced employee of the institution, upon a reasonable effort, to identify the record;
at the time of making the request, pay the $5.00 application fee that is prescribed by the Act’s regulations for seeking access to a record (payable to the Toronto Transit Commission).
2.0   Purposes
The TTC will use personal information that is collected for the following purposes:
to communicate with you;
assess and process applications for employment, information, injury/damage claims, pension, accident benefits, insurance benefits and/or sick benefits, as applicable;
evaluate and administer employment applications, tenders, proposals, contracts, injury/damage claims, pension benefits, accident benefits, insurance benefits and/or sick benefits, if applicable;

If the TTC requires personal information for any other purpose, save and except for as stated in 2.0 above, it will ask for and obtain verbal or written proof of your expressed consent before using it.
3.0  Consent
A person may provide consent in different ways for the collection, use or disclosure of personal information. When you do business with the TTC, the TTC asks that you provide information that it uses in the course of providing various services to you or to help in the investigation of claims.  By providing this information, you also give your implied consent to the TTC to use this information to provide you with various services and/or evaluate applications for various benefits.
Individuals can give consent in many ways. For example:
an application form may be used to seek consent, collect information, and inform the individual of the use that will be made of the information. By completing and signing the form, the individual is giving consent to the collection and the specified uses;
a check off box may be used to allow individuals to request that their names and addresses not be given to other organizations. Individuals who do not check the box are assumed to consent to the transfer of this information to third parties;
consent may be given orally when information is collected over the telephone; or
consent may be given at the time that individuals use a product or service.
TTC may collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge or consent in accordance with MFIPPA.
You may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and the requirement to maintain the integrity of the statistics and data necessary to carry on TTC business. However, the withdrawal of consent may affect the TTC’s ability to respond your requests and to provide you benefits.
4.0 Limiting Collection
The collection of personal information by TTC is limited to that which is necessary for the purposes identified in the MFIPPA and in section 2.0 above. All personal information is collected by the TTC in a fair and lawful manner.
5.0 Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention
Personal information will not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required by law, including any sections of the MFIPPA relating to the disclosure of personal information.

7.0 Safeguards
