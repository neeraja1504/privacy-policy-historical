Internet Privacy Policy
At TTI, we understand your concerns regarding privacy and we are committed to protecting your privacy. You can browse through most of this Site without having to provide personal information but you may be asked to register or fill out a form to access certain features. This Policy explains what information we collect, what we do with it, and how we maintain its privacy. Please read this entire policy before using this site. Also see the separate Terms of Use.
Information that we collect
We collect certain information in order to improve the features of our Site, to provide you with helpful information, to support our security procedures, and to help us contact you to resolve an issue. Nearly all personal information that we collect is explicitly provided by you through registration forms and request forms. Typically this is contact type information such as name, address, company, and email address.
In addition to information you provide to us explicitly, the Site uses technology to collect technical information such as your Internet Protocol address, your computer’s operating system, and your browser type. We use this information to help us improve the Site and to enable security.
Visitor Identification (“cookies”)
We may place information on your computer to allow us to identify you. This information is commonly known as “cookies”. We place cookies to help us create a faster user experience and to enforce certain security procedures. The use of cookies is a well-known industry standard. If you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified when they are placed, you may set your web browser to do so, if your browser so permits.
How we protect your privacy
TTI, Inc. takes several steps to safeguard your personal information -
Your personal information is stored on equipment that is protected from the Internet by a firewall (a device that prevents unauthorized access to a private network). Your information is protected to the same degree as we protect other TTI, Inc. confidential data from loss, misuse, disclosure, alteration, destruction or unauthorized access.
We only share aggregate statistics, if any, with third parties. TTI, Inc. will not disclose your personal information to outside parties unless you authorize us to do so, or unless we are obligated by law to do so, or unless we must disclose it to defend TTI, Inc. against some claim.
Whenever you sign into the Site we automatically encrypt your unique User ID and Password so that a third party cannot read it.
Your website Profile can only be accessed by the TTI, Inc. Security Department or by you, and it is associated with a unique User ID and Password, which you control.
You may change your password or other personal information at any time through the Profile page on the Site.
Emails
If you are registered with the Site we will occasionally send you emails about various products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. You may choose to stop receiving these emails at any time by using the “opt-out” link that is included in each email. Even if you have opted out, however, we still reserve the right to send you notices by email of changes to the Site.
Changes
We may change this Privacy Policy at any time with or without notice.
If you have any questions or comments concerning our privacy statement contact us at information@ttiinc.com.
