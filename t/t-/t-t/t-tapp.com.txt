Privacy Policy - T-Tapp
T-Tapp, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: T-Tapp.com.
We do not share any information about our users or customers with any third party.
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. This gives T-Tapp an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a users session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.
We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you’ve visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can’t read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. T-Tapp will only store information provided voluntarily, but this information is not personally identifiable. For your security and privacy, no payment, credit card, billing address, or any other personally identifiable information is stored in a cookie on your computer.
Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor’s experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.
Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address). We use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our company. The customer’s contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Other data collected from surveys is used for demographic purposes, to enhance our services for our visitors. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Contact information from the order form is used to send information about our company to our customers. The customer’s contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Information collected by T-Tapp.com will not be sold or redistributed in any manner and are held in the strictest confidence.
T-Tapp uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience’s demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. We do not share information about individual users with any third party.
Security: This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. A Secure Server Digital Certificate has been obtained from a valid Certificate Authority (CA) for www.T-Tapp.com from Thawte.
