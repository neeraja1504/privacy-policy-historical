**a) Purposes (Art. 6 (1) f GDPR / §15 (3) German Telemedia Act (Telemediengesetz – TMG)  **
Tag management
Tag management is used to manage tracking tools in websites. A tag is set for each page to do this. Based on the tag, the system can determine which tracking tools should be used for this page. Tag management can be used to specifically control tracking so that the tools are only used where appropriate.
Market research / Reach measurement
Reach measurement provides statistics on a website’s usage intensity and the number of users, along with comparable figures for all the connected services. Individual users are not identified at any time. Your identity is always protected.
b) Techniques
Cookies
We use cookies for certain services. These are small text files that are stored on your computer. They enable the system to tell if you repeatedly visit websites from the same computer.
Session cookies are cookies which are only stored on your computer for the duration of your Internet session and are required for transactions (e.g. to log in or to complete a purchase). They simply contain a transaction ID.
For certain services, we use persistent cookies, which are stored on your computer for future sessions. In this case, we notify you about the cookie’s storage period.

Measurement pixels
Measurement pixels are simply images measuring 1×1 pixels. They are transparent or are the same color as the background, making them invisible. If a website is opened that contains a measurement pixel, this small image is then downloaded from the provider’s server on the Internet and the download is recorded on the server. This way the process provider can see when and how many users requested this measurement pixel or visited a website. The provider can also see whether JavaScript is enabled or not in the browser. If JavaScript is enabled, additional information such as browser information, operating system, screen resolution can be recorded.
This function is normally executed by calling JavaScript; nonetheless the term measurement pixel is still used.
JavaScript
JavaScripts are used to call the application and to transfer the collected parameters to the particular service provider/measurement pixel provider.
