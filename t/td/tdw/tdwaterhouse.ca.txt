The TD Bank Financial Group commitment to privacy
Protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information has always been fundamental to the way we do business within TD Bank Financial Group.
We strive to provide you with the best customer service. To us, that includes treating you fairly and with respect.
This Privacy Code² informs you of our policy on privacy, and tells you about the ways we help ensure that your privacy and the confidentiality of your information are protected.
Our privacy policy
Our privacy policy applies to personal customers, including individuals carrying on business alone or in partnership with other individuals. It consists of five key principles:
1. Collecting and using information
Either before or when we collect information about you, we will explain how we intend to use it. We will limit the information we collect to what we need for those purposes, and we will use it only for those purposes. We will obtain your consent if we wish to use your information for any other purpose and before collecting information from third parties such as credit bureaus.
Your personal financial information is used to help us manage operations and risk within TD Bank Financial Group. Your information is also used in order to satisfy valid information requests from regulators and other organizations or individuals who are legally entitled to make such requests.
Call Taping
We may monitor and/or record your telephone discussions with our representatives for our mutual protection, to enhance customer service, and to confirm our discussions with you.
Customers who prefer not to have their calls taped can transact business at a branch location, through EasyWeb, or through automated banking machines.
2. Releasing information
We may provide your information to other persons -
where we have your consent
where the other parties are our suppliers or agents who assist us in serving you
where we are required or permitted to do so by law or applicable regulators and self-regulatory organizations
where transfers of a business are involved
3. Protecting information
We will protect your information with appropriate safeguards and security measures. We will retain your information only for the time it is required for the purposes we explain.
4. Providing information access and accuracy
We will give you access to the information we retain about you. We will make every reasonable effort to keep your information accurate and up-to-date.
5. Respecting and responding to your privacy concerns
In this Privacy Code, we will explain your options for refusing or withdrawing consent to the collection, use and release of your information, and we will record and respect your choices. We will investigate and respond to your concerns about any aspect of our handling of your information.
In this Privacy Code, we will explain how we fulfill each of these important principles.
Why we ask for your information
We ask you for information to establish and serve you as our customer.
We obtain most of our information about you directly from you. The information we ask for depends on which product or service you want. For every product or service, we need your name, address, birthdate, occupation and some identification. Here is why we need some of the other information we ask you to provide.
• Birth date
This helps us identify you and ensure that no one is trying to impersonate you. We may also use it to determine your eligibility for products and services that may be of benefit to a particular age group.
• Social Insurance Number (SIN)
Your SIN is required for products which earn investment income, in order to comply with the Canada Revenue Agency's income reporting requirements. Providing your SIN for credit products is optional. If you provide your SIN, we also use it to keep your information separate from that of other customers with a similar name, including information we obtain with your consent through the credit approval process.
• Financial information
This is used to assess your eligibility for any credit product, for example, a TD Visa * card, line of credit or other loan. We also use it to ensure that the advice we give you or the investments you purchase (in the case of mutual funds or brokerage or investment accounts) are appropriate for you. We may collect information from you and service providers with whom you make arrangements to provide those services (for example when you set up bill payments through your account). We will use your financial information, including transaction records that reflect your business dealings with and through us, to help us serve you as a customer and meet your financial needs.
• Health information
This is required for some insurance products to ensure you are eligible for coverage, and may also be used to investigate and adjudicate your claims, and to help manage and assess our risks.
The health-related information you provide in connection with an insurance product will never be shared within TD Bank Financial Group; however, it may be shared with administrators, service providers and reinsurers of the insurance operations to process your insurance transactions.
We only collect the information we need and only use it for the purposes explained to you.
When you apply for a new product or service, we will indicate in the application or agreement how we intend to use your information. We will only ask for the information we need for that particular product or service. We will indicate clearly which information would help us to serve you but is optional for you to provide.
Why we share your information
We share information within TD Bank Financial Group to manage our business risks and operations, and to comply with legal or regulatory requirements. With your consent, we may share your information within TD Bank Financial Group. This will help us serve you better and determine whether any products or services of TD Bank Financial Group are suitable for you so that we can offer them to you.
We want to serve you better and meet your customer service expectations. Agreeing to let us share your information within TD Bank Financial Group helps us to meet this goal.
Sharing information lets us instantly recognize your total relationship with TD Bank Financial Group, no matter when or where you contact us or which one of us you contact. It also means that in some circumstances, changes to your information can be made once and be effective for all your products or services with TD Bank Financial Group.
Sharing your information also helps us determine your financial needs because it allows us to review what TD Bank Financial Group products you have and how you use them. We may then offer you other TD Bank Financial Group products and services - including special promotions - that we believe will be of interest to you.
This consent is optional and you can decide to withdraw it at any time for the purposes listed above. Please refer to the "Respecting your preference" section.
Why we ask others for information about you
With your consent, we may obtain information about you from third parties, including credit reporting agencies.
Obtaining additional information about you from parties outside TD Bank Financial Group helps us assess your eligibility for our products.
For credit products, for example, we need to know your creditworthiness. For this reason, we may contact other lenders or credit reporting agencies to get information about you and your credit history. We may also contact employers or other personal references to verify information that you have given us. We will not do this without your consent, but please remember that if you do not give your consent we may not be able to extend credit services to you.
When we release your information
We do not sell customer lists or information to others. However, we may release your information to parties outside TD Bank Financial Group in certain circumstances, which include -
• With your consent
On an ongoing basis, we will disclose your credit history with us to other lenders or credit reporting agencies in order to support the credit process. We release only the information required to identify you, as well as facts from our credit records about your repayment history.
• For servicing purposes
We give a limited amount of information, only as necessary, without your consent, to our suppliers and agents; for example, cheque printers and bank card manufacturers who provide goods and services to you through us. These suppliers and agents may be located in other jurisdictions or countries.
• When required or permitted to do so by law or applicable regulators and self-regulatory organizations
We must give information in response to a valid demand, search warrant or other legally valid enquiry or order. This may include legally valid requests from regulators and self-regulators who are responsible for ensuring TD Bank Financial Group is in compliance with applicable financial regulations (e.g. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and the Investment Dealers Association of Canada). We may disclose information to help us collect a debt owed to us by you. We may also disclose information to an investigative body in the case of a breach of agreement or contravention of law - this helps prevent fraud, money laundering or other criminal activity.
• Transfers of a business
As TD Bank Financial Group continues to develop and grow, we may buy or sell parts of our businesses. As our businesses consist primarily of our customer relationships, personal customer information and information regarding the particular account or service being purchased or sold would generally be one of the transferred business assets.
How we protect your information
We will protect your information with appropriate safeguards and security measures.
We have thorough security standards to protect our systems and your information against unauthorized access and use.
For example, our systems have been designed to ensure that your Personal Identification Number (PIN), password and other access codes are always private and confidential. When you use your PIN at an automated banking machine, it is scrambled after you enter it. For your protection, your access codes are known only to you - our employees cannot gain access to them and they will not ask you to reveal them.
All our suppliers and agents, as part of their contracts with TD Bank Financial Group, are bound to maintain your confidentiality and may not use the information for any unauthorized purpose.
When we provide information in response to a legal enquiry or order, we ensure that the order is valid and we disclose only the information that is legally required.
All employees of TD Bank Financial Group are familiar with the procedures that must be taken to safeguard customer information. And to us, protecting the confidentiality of your information is more than a procedure - it's part of our job. It is specified in our employment agreements and regularly confirmed in writing.
We audit our procedures and security measures regularly to ensure that they are being properly administered and that they remain effective and appropriate.
We retain your information only as long as it is required for the reasons it was collected.
The length of time we retain information varies depending on the product or service and the nature of the information. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us but only for so long as it is legally necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issue that may arise at a later date. When your information is no longer needed for the purposes explained to you, we have procedures to destroy, delete, erase or convert it to an anonymous form.
Your right to access your information
We will give you access to the information we have about you.
Most of this information is in the form of your transaction records. These are available to you through your account statements or passbook updates, by visiting the branch or office where your account is held, or by accessing your account through our EasyWeb™ Internet banking, EasyLine™ telephone banking, Wireless banking, Green Machine* automated banking machines, and brokerage services.
If you require other information, simply contact or forward a written request to the branch or office where your account is held. We will ask you for specific details such as branch and account number. We will advise you in advance if a minimal charge will be required for conducting the search, and we will respond to your request within 30 days.
Please note that we may not be able to provide information about you from our records which contains references to other persons, is subject to legal privilege, contains confidential information proprietary to TD Bank Financial Group, relates to an investigation of a breach of agreement or contravention of laws, or cannot be disclosed for other legal reasons. Also, we do not maintain disclosure records for regular or routine actions such as T5 or other reports to Canada Revenue Agency, regular updating of credit information to credit reporting agencies, or account balance deficiencies through the return of NSF items.
If you have any questions regarding decisions made about you, we will tell you the reasons for those decisions. Where relevant, we will provide you with the name and address of the credit bureau from which a report was obtained.
Keeping your information accurate
We will make every reasonable effort to keep your information accurate and up-to-date.
Having accurate information about you enables us to give you the best possible service. Allowing us to share your information within TD Bank Financial Group means that, in some circumstances, updates to your information can be made once and be effective for all the products and services you have with TD Bank Financial Group.
You can help by keeping us informed of any changes, such as if you move or change telephone numbers. If you find any errors in our information about you, let us know and we will make the corrections immediately, and make sure they are conveyed to anyone we may have misinformed. For information that remains in dispute, we will note your opinion in the file.
Respecting your preference
_
We will explain your options of refusing or withdrawing consent to the collection, use or release of your information, and we will record and respect your choices.
_
In most cases you are free to refuse or withdraw your consent at any time. You may do so by contacting the branch or office where your account is held or by calling us at 1-800-430-6095. Our staff will be pleased to explain your options and any consequences of refusing or withdrawing your consent, and record your choices.
There are several privacy preferences available to you, subject to legal, business or contractual requirements. If you prefer, you may choose not to have us -
Use your Social Insurance Number with credit reporting agencies as an aid to identify you
Conduct a credit check in order to assess an application for credit
In doing so, however, we may not be able to extend credit services to you. Once you have a credit product with us, we will share your credit experience on an ongoing basis with other lenders and credit reporting agencies. You cannot withdraw your consent for this sharing of information as it is necessary to support the credit process.
Contact you occasionally either by mail, telephone, or email, or all of these methods, with direct marketing offers that may be of benefit to you
This does not include messages or other information about promotional offers we provide on, or enclosed with, your written or electronic account statements, or that we may discuss while talking with you. Any marketing campaigns that are already underway may not immediately take your preferences into account.
Share your financial and account information with other members of TD Bank Financial Group
This does not apply if you have requested a product or service that is jointly offered by more than one member of TD Bank Financial Group.
Contact you to participate in customer research and surveys
Addressing your concerns
If you have any questions, concerns or problems about privacy, confidentiality or how a request for information was handled, you can take the following actions. If you choose to mail, fax or email us, please include your full name, address and telephone number.

Elevation to a Senior Officer
If you are not satisfied with the solution you receive from the Manager in Step 1, the Manager will offer to elevate your problem - communicating all relevant details on your behalf - to a representative of the Senior Management Officer responsible for the branch or business unit.

If it is determined that your problem has not been addressed by the Senior Management Officer as described in Step 2, then the TD Ombudsman may direct your problem to the appropriate business area for investigation and response.

Our online privacy policy
Visiting our information sites
Using our Internet transaction services
Cookies
Email comments, questions or responses
Responding to games, contests or surveys
Protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information has always been fundamental to the way we do business with you within TD Bank Financial Group, whether over the Internet, on the telephone or at our branches and offices.
We developed our Privacy Code brochure to inform you of our policy on privacy and tell you about the ways we ensure that your privacy and the confidentiality of your information are protected.
Many of you have questions about how we are handling the information we obtain from you when you visit our websites. This online privacy policy will answer your questions about the information we collect when you visit a TD Bank Financial Group website, and how we use it.
Visiting our information sites
When you go directly to the information portion of our websites and move from page to page, read pages or download content onto your computer, we learn which pages are visited, what content is downloaded, and the address of websites that you visited immediately before coming to our websites. However, none of this is associated with you as an individual. It is measured only in aggregate.
We use this information to find out how many people visit our websites and which sections of the sites are visited most frequently. This helps us to know what type of information is most useful to you so that we can improve our websites and make it easier for you to access information. We record the statistical information on the numbers of visitors to our websites, but no information about you in particular will be kept or used.
Using our Internet transaction services
When you register for one of our Internet transaction services, such as EasyWeb, we compile a profile of you for that service (e.g. name, address, account numbers, login ID, etc.). Each time you use our Internet services, we collect your login ID, information about the transactions that you complete and the informational pages of the web that you visit while using the service.
We use your profile in responding to your enquiries on the service. We use your login ID to identify you as a user of the service. We use the transaction information in the aggregate to assess and improve the service.
We use specific transaction information for servicing purposes (e.g. billing). We use both your transaction information and the informational pages of the website that you have visited to determine your financial needs so that we can offer other TD Bank Financial Group products and services to you.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file containing certain pieces of information that a website creates when you visit the site. It can track how and when you use a site, which site you visited immediately before, and it can store that information about you.
There are two common types of cookies, "session cookies" and "persistent cookies". Session cookies store information only for the length of time that you are connected to a website - they are not written onto your hard drive. Once you leave the website, the originator of the cookie no longer has the information that was contained on it.
TD Bank Financial Group uses session cookies as an additional security feature for its online services. For example, when you login to any web service and are authenticated through your login ID and password, a cookie will store the identification number of your browser. Throughout your session, the cookie acts as a type of digital signature to identify your current session to the web server.
We also use session cookies to track your visits within our site. We use that information to determine the type of information that you are looking for in our site and to improve our site. We use information about the site you visited immediately prior to our site to assess the viability of links to our site that we have created on third party sites.
The information stored in "persistent cookies" is written onto your hard drive and remains there until the expiry date of the cookie. TD Bank Financial Group uses persistent cookies to store non-sensitive information that you are aware of and have agreed to. For example, if you choose the option on our login screen to remember your TD Canada Trust Access Card number or Connect ID for EasyWeb or WebBroker*, the system will remember and automatically input your Access Card number or Connect ID each time you use the service from that PC.
EasyWeb Internet banking also employs two additional "persistent" cookies, designed to deliver a more comfortable online banking experience to you. The first is placed on your computer's hard drive to remember your language preference and ensure you are always presented with EasyWeb Internet banking in the appropriate language. The second is employed to ensure that any online targeted offer which you have already responded to is not presented again each time you login to EasyWeb Internet banking.
All persistent cookies used by EasyWeb Internet banking are encrypted for additional security.
Currently, most browsers do not distinguish between session cookies and persistent cookies. For web services to operate, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you are concerned about having your browser enabled to accept cookies while you are surfing other websites, we recommend that you enable your browser to notify you when it is receiving a cookie. This gives you the ability of accepting or rejecting any cookie presented by the web server you are visiting.
Email comments, questions or responses
When you send us an email or when you ask us to respond to you by email, we learn your exact email address and any information you have included in the email.
We use your email address to acknowledge your comments and/or reply to your questions, and we will store your communication and our reply in case we correspond further. We will not sell your email address to anyone outside TD Bank Financial Group. We may use your email address to send you information about offers on products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. If you don't want us to contact you by email with offers on products and services, you may tell us so at any time.
If you have asked us to put you on an email mailing list to provide you with certain information on a regular basis, or if we send you information about our offers on products and services by email, you may ask us to remove you from the list at any time (using the unsubscribe instructions provided with each email and on the site where you signed up).
Remember that email sent over the Internet is generally unencrypted. If TD Bank Financial Group requests that you transmit confidential information to us over the Internet when filling out an application online, we ensure that such transmission is encrypted. We recommend that you use caution when forwarding free-format email messages to us and that you do not include confidential information (such as account numbers) in those messages, as they are not encrypted.
Important Information About Preventing Email Fraud: From time to time, fraudulent emails may be circulated to you claiming to have been issued by Canadian banks, requesting customers to verify their personal and/or banking information. Customers are often asked to click on a link in the email that directs them to a pop-up window or modified online banking login page to enter their respective bank's login ID and password.
We will never send email messages to customers requesting confidential information such as passwords or account numbers. Please do not act on any such emails as you may compromise your banking information by following links to a counterfeit Internet site(s).
Responding to games, contests or surveys
When you submit your answers to a game or contest or submit your response to a survey question, we learn your answer or any opinions or information that you volunteer.
We will use your submission for the purpose of awarding a prize in a contest. We use your submission to come up with the game or survey results, and we may publish those results in aggregate on our websites. We may use your response to improve our website or other products or services of TD Bank Financial Group. Based on your response, we may forward information about our offers on products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.
