4. Personal data collection, processing and use initiated
In principle, the collection, application and use of personal data is not required for use of an internet site. Such action is not taken by us. Data collection, processing or use is only made if you specify your personal data on a voluntary basis. This may be required, for example, in the following cases:

Prior registration may be required for the conclusion of a license agreement. For this, personal data have to be specified. The following personal data are requested in such a process:
Name, first name
Email Adress

If you wish to receive our newsletter, we require a functional email address allocated to your name as well as other personal data which enable us to check that you are the owner of the email address specified. You can withdraw approval of storage of personal data, the email address and its use for the dispatch of newsletters at any time.
c) Handling of the contract
It may be necessary to pass on your personal data to companies which we commission to provide services or to handle the contract. These may include e.g. transport companies or other service companies. There is no passing on of data to third parties outside the purpose of handling business dealings.
d) Passing on of data to third parties or to state institutions and authorities
Passing on of data to third parties in other cases is only made if you have given prior approval to such action. You are entitled to revoke an approval granted at any time taking immediate effect for the future.
We only pass on data to state institutions and authorities authorized to receive such information within the scope of legal obligations or as a result of a court order.
e) Data transfer to another country
We transfer data to other countries. It is ensured that the recipient of data ensures appropriate data protection and especially undertakes to observe the ‚Safe-Harbour‘ principle (i.e. acceptance of minimum standards for the handling of customer data) and that no other interests worthy of protection on the part of the customer speak against such data transfer. To ensure appropriate level of protection at the recipient of data we use the model contract of the European Union for the transfer of data into other EU states in the revised version of the decision of the European Commission dated 05.02.2010.
f) Google Analytics
This website / the connected services use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. ("Google").

5. Minors
We take special care to ensure protection of personal data of children.

6. Right to Information
You have the right to demand information on data stored about your person at any time, also with regard to recipients or categories of recipients to which data is passed on and the purpose of storage, in so far as such information relates to the origin of such data. Please address your enquiry to the respective center specified below.
7. Deletion and Blocking
We undertake to delete the data processed for our own purposes as soon as their content is no longer required for the fulfillment of the purpose of storage. Blocking replaces a deletion in so far as a deletion conflicts with legal, statutory or contractual safeguarding periods, or there is reason to assume that interests worthy of protection of the person involved may be impaired by deletion, or if a deletion is not possible due to the special type of storage involved, or would only be possible at disproportionate, unreasonable expense.
In addition, you can have data collected by us blocked, adjusted or deleted at any time. Deletion only takes place if you withdraw your approval for the collection, processing and usage of personal data. If such withdrawal is declared in the course of a business transaction, deletion is made immediately on completion of such.
Further legal deletion or blocking obligations remain unaffected.
8. Technical and organizational Measures
We undertake to take technical and organizational measures required to ensure execution of regulations concerning data protection in so far as expenditure is at a reasonable level in view of the protection purpose aimed for.
