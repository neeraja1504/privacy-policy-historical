This means we may acquire, record and analyze portions of the data that is entered into, stored on, and/or transmitted through this site by each visitor. This information is only released -- when legally required -- to help law enforcement investigations, legal proceedings or internal investigations of HSC rule and regulation violations. These groups would use the information to track the electronic interactions back to the source computer(s) or account(s).
Some HSC web pages may collect personal information about visitors and use that information for purposes other than those stated above. Each web page that collects such information will have a separate privacy statement that will tell you how that information is used.
