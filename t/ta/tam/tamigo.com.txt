We ask for and collect personal information such as your name, phone number and email address, as well as the company name when a trial subscription account is being created.

The services also include our customer support, where you can choose to submit information regarding a problem you are experiencing or a question you may have regarding our services. You may be asked to provide the customer (subscription account) name, your contact details and any relevant information regarding the case, in order for the supporter to be able to investigate the question faster and get back to you with an answer.
2.2. Information we automatically collect when you use our services
Logs regarding your use of our services
As is the case with most websites and services, we gather and log certain information when you use our services. Examples of such collected data include login timestamps, changes to data of the subscription account and timestamps of such changes.

2.3 Integrating other services with your subscription account
You can choose to set up an integration between our services and other service providers you may be using. Such integrations can include exchanges of personal or financial data – import, update and export. We will perform integrations on behalf of the account subscriber owner and expect other service providers to be authorised by the account subscriber to handle such data transfers.
Information that is collected during the execution of integrations include the timestamp of execution, transfer endpoint, transfer status and response message returned from the other service. If the integration involves a file transfer, the contents of the integration files are kept for 90 days.

If you do not wish to be contacted, please inform us by sending an email to  support@tamigo.com.
To send promotional information
We may send promotional communications to you via email, such as providing you with information about services via newsletters. You can opt out of receiving marketing communications from us by clicking “Unsubscribe” at the bottom of the email message at any time.
For safety and security, and to provide you with insights into the use of services

We may access information in your subscription account to resolve technical issues you encounter and also to respond to your requests for assistance. We store the information in our support tool Zendesk.
To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights
Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.
We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above.
Legal basis for processing (for EU/EEA users only)
If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal basis for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal basis depends on the services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only in the following cases:
— We need it to provide you with services, including to operate the services and provide customer support.
— It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests) to protect our legal rights and interests.
— You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose.
— We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.
If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time. Please note that this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
4. How we handle the information we collect
tamigo does not transfer information to third parties, unless specifically instructed to do so by the subscriber.
Integrations with third parties
If requested by the subscriber, data from the subscription account may be transferred to specified third parties. These kinds of integrations typically include one or more of the following data types: payroll, financial, attendance, personal or health data. It is up to the subscriber to decide what data should be shared with which third party, for how long, and when such sharing should take place.
As the integration only happens upon the request of an account subscriber, it is the responsibility of the account subscriber to check that the third-party systems are authorised to handle the data they receive.
We work with third-party service providers that provide hosting and maintenance of our services, application development, backup, storage, analytics, SMS, email and other services. These third-party service providers may, upon our request, have access to or process your personal information for the purpose of providing these services for us. We do not permit our third-party service providers to use the personal information we share with them for their marketing purposes or for any other purpose than in connection with the services they provide to us.
You can find a list of our service providers in our Data Processing Agreement on our Trust Centre.
Compliance with enforcement requests and applicable laws and enforcement of our Rights
In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services, (d) protect tamigo , our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.
5. How we store and secure the information we collect
5.1. Information storage and security
Depending on the customer’s physical location, the subscription account information may be stored in one of two locations: for customers located in Australia, subscription account information is stored in Australia, and for all other customers data is stored in the EU. This is the case for all data submitted by users of a particular subscription account, as well as the logs that arise from using tamigo services.
We use service providers for SMS, email and support functionality. These service providers are all based in and store data in the EU/EAA.
5.2. How long we keep information
How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below.
Account subscriber information
If you choose to suspend your account, data provided to create a paid subscription account (refer to 2.1. Account and profile information) will remain in tamigo.
Subscription account data
We retain your account data for as long as you have a paid subscription. If we do not receive payments for 30 days after the due date, your account will be deactivated.
If you choose to terminate the subscription, your data will be removed 90 days after the expiration of the subscription.
