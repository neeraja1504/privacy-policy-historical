Privacy Policy - TabletWise
TabletTree Inc. and its subsidiaries ("TabletWise," "us" or "we") operates this website (the "Site"), and other health, wellness, diet, fitness, online learning websites that are part of the TabletTree portfolio of websites (collectively, the "Sites") and the services related to or offered on the Sites (hereinafter, the "Services"). Some of the Sites are websites that we may operate on behalf of third party licensors (collectively, "Licensors"). TabletWise's Services may include, without limitation, tools, applications, email services, bulletin boards, message boards, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities, calendars, downloadable mobile applications, video streaming services, audio streaming services, and online, or offline courses related to the Sites or provided through the Sites.
Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Privacy Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of Personal Information (as defined below) and Anonymous Information (as defined below).
We provide you this privacy policy (the "Policy") to help you understand the kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit the Site or use any of our Services, how we may use and disclose the information, and how you can control, correct and/or update the information. To be clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase "Personal Information" in this Policy, we mean information that specifically identifies you as an individual, like a person’s full name, address, email address, or phone number. When we use the phrase "Anonymous Information" in this Policy, we mean information that does not specifically identify an individual person, such as a user’s areas of interest, browsing history, demographic information, or a unique identifier (such as a cookie or IP address).
By visiting this Site or using the Services, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Policy. Each time you visit the Site or use the Services, you agree and expressly consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of the information that you provide as described in this Policy. If you do not agree to any of these terms, you should not use the Services. This Policy applies to all users, including both users who are simply viewing content available via the Services and users who have registered as members of the Site.
We may, at our sole discretion, modify this Policy at any time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make material changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services or sending you an email or by updating this page. By accessing the Services at any time after such modifications, you are agreeing to be bound by the updated Policy. This Privacy Policy was last modified on May 2nd, 2019.
In addition to this general Policy, each Service may have additional privacy provisions that are specific to the particular Service. These supplemental disclosures are made adjacent to the particular Service at the time we collect the information. These supplemental disclosures also govern the use of your information.
If you are located in the European Union (“EU”), the United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data. These rights are outlined in the EU Privacy Notice section.
The Information We Gather
We collect information about you in the following ways:
1. #### Information You Voluntarily Provide Us
We collect and maintain information that you voluntarily submit to us during your use of the Sites and Services. For example: when you register for a Site, you may provide us certain information including your name, email address, screen name, password, demographic information and the health topics that interest you; to engage a Site's social networking function, you may add to your profile (“Profile”) by providing information about your interests or health topics. For example, your Profile may list your favorite healthy foods or movie; if you are registering for a customized weight loss program, you may provide us answers to questions we use to provide you the program, like your actual and goal weights, your preferred method of exercise, or your caloric intake; if you sign up to receive a newsletter, enter a contest or participate in social networking activities, you may provide us contact information (e.g., email or physical address); if you purchase a product or service, you may provide us your credit card information; and you may provide us with Personal Information in the course of email, customer support interactions, and surveys. For example, when registering for a course or class, you may provide with your name, email, general location, telephone number or other data. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may stop you from gaining access to a Service or limit the features that you can use. Transactions on Site involving your billing and payment information are processed by PayPal and Stripe and are subject to their privacy policies. We do not store any of the credit card or banking information that you provide to these payment processors. For more information, please see the How We Use Your Information section below.
Any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose in public areas becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by other users for any reason. Your Profile pages and any online classrooms you participate in are typically publicly available. You have the ability to change your account settings to limit access to your Profile, and may delete content you post to public classrooms. You should exercise caution before disclosing your Personal Information via these or any other public venues.
For example, if you choose to sign up for an account, you may have a Profile on the site, containing your full name and some basic information including your location and bio. You may also add additional optional information to your Profile. You may control what type of Profile information is shown to others through your Account Settings. Any information you choose to provide as part of your Profile should reflect how much you want other Site users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage members to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages. You can review and revise Profile information at any time.
2. #### Information We Collect Through Your Use of the Site
As you use the Site and Services, certain information may also be passively collected. Through cookies, pixels, beacons, log files, your device information, and other technologies, we may collect information about how you use the Site and the Services. For example, we may determine through an IP address that a particular computer or device is located in New York City and we may use this information to deliver advertisements promoting New York City-based businesses. This information allows us to deliver more helpful information, programs, tools, and advertisements. Please see the Cookies and Targeted Advertising sections below for more information.
3. #### Information We Receive From Third Parties
We may also combine online and/or offline information received from third parties with the information we have already collected from you via our Sites and Services. The third party information is used for a variety of purposes including to verify other information about you (e.g., verify your mailing address to send you requested products or services), to conduct research and to enhance the content, services, and advertising we provide to you.
4. #### Information We Receive From Authentication Services
You can log on to our site using single sign-on services such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and Microsoft. These services allow us to authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us, such as your name, email address, and contacts address book. We collect personal information from these services to the extent you authorize us to do so, and our collection, use and disclosure of this data is governed by this privacy policy. We do not share this collected data with any third party.
How We Use Your Information
We will use your Personal Information in the ways described below or described at the time that the information is collected.
1. #### To Provide the Sites and Services
In general, we use your Personal Information as necessary or appropriate for purposes including to administer your account; register you and provide you access to the Site or Services; respond to inquiries or requests that you direct to us; fulfill your requests for products or services; send communications and administrative emails about the Sites or Services; personalize and better tailor the features, performance and support of the Sites and Services for your use; send you promotional/marketing information, newsletters, offers or other information regarding opportunities and functionality that we think would be of particular interest to you; improve the quality of the Site and the Services, and analyze, benchmark and conduct research on user data and user interactions with the Site and Services. We may give some or all of this information to the teachers (“Teachers”) for classes or courses that you sign up for so that they can coordinate their classes, seek feedback on classes, communicate with you, and provide you with additional services. As part of our Terms of Use, Site Teachers agree not to abuse other users' Personal Data. Abuse is defined as using Personal Data for any purpose other than those explicitly specified in the Teachers' Class. However, please understand that Teachers are not our employees or consultants and that we are not a party to any transaction between you and the Teacher. As a result, we cannot control their actions and cannot be held liable for any actions that they may take.
2. #### Advertising
We believe that advertising is more interesting to you when it is relevant. Accordingly, we customize the advertisements that you see based upon: (i) the information that you provide us (e.g., age, gender, stated health interests and other information in your profile); (ii) geographic location information, which we may determine through your IP address, from your mobile device, or other ways; (iii) data we receive from third parties or; (iv) your visits on the Sites or use of Services (commonly referred to as "Behavioral Advertising"). Please see the Cookies and Targeted Advertising section below for more information on the use of cookies and the information collected for Behavioral Advertising. We may use your Personal Information to deliver customized advertising to you on this Site, on other websites and on other digital and offline media channels.
Cookies and Targeted Advertising
Cookies, Web Beacons, and IP Address Information
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website places on your browser when you visit that website. We may use cookies to provide you with more personal and interactive experience with the Sites and Services. For example, we may use cookies to control what advertisements you see, the sequence of advertisements and to make sure you don't see the same advertisement too many times. For contests or sweepstakes, we may also use cookies in order to track your progress and the number of entries in some promotions. For surveys or classes or courses, we may use cookies to help ensure that an individual can't vote more than once on a particular question or issue. We do not store Personal Information in any cookies on your computer. Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser's directions usually within the help menu. In order to use certain Services offered through the Sites, your web browser must accept cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, some aspects of the Sites may not work properly, and you may not be able to access our Services. We may also use cookies, pixels, web beacons (which are usually small, transparent graphic images), operating system and device information and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, the features and information for which you searched and viewed, the email you opened, or on which advertisements you clicked. This type of information is collected to make the Sites and Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We, or our service providers, may use your IP Address when you access the Sites or Services or use other means to assist with delivering geographically targeted advertisements.
2. #### Targeted Advertising
Companies Site works with may use cookies for purposes including understanding Web usage patterns of users who see advertisements on the Sites, controlling the sequence of advertisements you see, making sure you don't see the same advertisement too many times, determining your interests and tailoring advertisements and promotions based on those interests. For example, if you read an article about a particular health condition on the Sites, we may use cookies from a vendor to later serve you an advertisement for a product related to the viewed article. These third-party vendors may connect information about the pages you visit on our Sites with information about the pages you visit on other websites and media channels and show you advertising based on this combined information. The advertisement may appear when you are visiting a different section of this Site or another website or media channel if the website or media channel also has a relationship with us or our vendor.
3. #### Information Collected by Third-Party Advertisers
Advertisers or other third parties on the Sites may also engage in Behavioral Advertising and use cookies and web beacons in the manner described above. We do not control these advertisers or other parties' use of cookies or web beacons or what they do with the information they collect. Many third-party vendors that engage in Behavioral Advertising participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and abide by NAI and/or DAA principles. If you wish to opt out of participating in advertising programs conducted by NAI and DAA members or learn more about the NAI and DAA, please go to the NAI Opt-Out website and DAA Choice Page and follow the instructions. After you opt-out, you will still see advertisements, but the advertising may not be as relevant to your interests. If you change your computer, change your browser or delete your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out.
