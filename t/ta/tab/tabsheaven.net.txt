Data Collection and Opt Out
tabsHeaven.net itself does not utilise cookies or any other means to collect personally-identifiable information about our visitors.

Guitar PRO files
The aim of tabsHeaven.net is to transmit some useful resources for musicians that wish to improve their skills. Therefore, the content of the files is to be used for private study, scholarship or research only. Moreover, the goal is also to give to the guitarist a chance to make original arrangements of songs and to share them with other guitarists. Consequently, these tabs are a personal interpretation of a musical arrangement by a Guitar Pro user and do not intend to provide a precise tab of the artist. If you notice any Guitar Pro files with a copyright infraction, warn us and the file will be deleted.
We do not aspire to infringe copyrights, and we embolden you to purchase the artist's album and official song book.
