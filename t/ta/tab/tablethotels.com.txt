Privacy Policy | Tablet Hotels
Since the year 2000, the Tablet team has been committed to protecting the privacy and data of all of our clients and users around the world. Here at Tablet, we've never sold and will never sell your personal data to third parties. We also want to be transparent about the data that we collect, how we use it and your rights to control that information. This is why we have made some updates to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, which take effect on May 25, 2018.
We made these updates to reflect the high standards established by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a set of laws passed in the European Union. We embrace these changes and because we believe all Tablet clients and users should have the right to these protections, we are implementing these updates globally.
The GDPR applies to any information that directly or indirectly could identify you as an individual. This includes information, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, as well as IP addresses, cookie identifiers, device information, billing information, geo-location information, social media information, your preferences, etc.
As a registered client of Tablet Hotels, you can always see the information that you've shared with us in "Your Account".
We hope you'll find that these updates improve your customer experience and reinforce our commitment to your data privacy and security. If you have any questions or comments, send us a message at privacy@tablethotels.com. View our Terms of Use.

3.1. Personal Information
We don't sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize our Products and Services, content and advertising.
Our primary purpose in collecting Personal Information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. You agree that we may use your Personal Information:
to provide the Products, Services and customer support you request;
resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;
to record your preferences, make Reservations and communicate with you about your Reservations;
to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities such as negligence, breach of contract or fraud, and enforce our Terms and Conditions and other policies;

to tell you about our Products and Services, targeted marketing, updates, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences;

for any other purpose to which you affirmatively consent.
We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, Member ID, password, national identification numbers or related Personal Information in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.
3.2. Aggregated Information
We may use Aggregated Information to describe our user base to current or potential partners, investors and advertisers; after a survey, to understand and respond to market needs and preferences; or to make recommendations to other users of our Site. For example, if users of our Site who have traveled to a particular destination told us that they had positive experiences at a hotel in that destination, we might recommend that hotel.
4. How We Share Your Information
We may also share your Personal Information from time to time as follows:
to hotels and other third-party service providers with which you make arrangements through our Site;
to organizations that perform services for or on behalf of Tablet, such as couriers or shippers, credit card processors, marketing or research providers, data processors. NOTE: We will share with these companies only that Personal Information which they need to work on our behalf. Some of these service providers may be located in countries outside the US and outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").Your Personal Information will be provided to these organizations only if they agree to use such information solely for the purpose of providing services to Tablet, and under the instructions of Tablet, and with respect to that information, to act in a manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this Privacy Policy. By submitting your personal data, you agree to the transfer, storing and processing of your data outside the US and outside the EEA;
to third-parties with whom we are collaborating to offer you additional Products or Services such as sweepstakes, raffles and promotions. We will share Personal Information that is necessary for these other companies to provide the Products or Services that you have requested;
to protect our Site and our rights under our Terms and Conditions; to protect ourselves against liability or prevent fraudulent activity; or where it is necessary to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain;
where the information is public; or
to regulatory agencies.
Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the Site free from bad actors, we will not otherwise disclose your Personal Information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity. In such circumstances, we will attempt to contact you, where permitted by law, before first making such disclosure.
5. Storage, Retention and Protection of Personal Information
5.1. Storage and Retention
If you are a Member, we store your Personal Information in Your Account. You can access Your Account from the home page of our Site, after logging onto our Site. Your Account contains your name, e-mail address, e-mail and password settings, and related travel information. It may also contain other information so that you do not need to re-enter it each time you make a Reservation. It may also contain details about your participation in loyalty or awards programs and applicable membership numbers and other travel preferences. We also keep in Your Account all other information that you have elected to provide us, such as gender, activities and lifestyle preferences and favorite hotels or destinations.
You can access or modify your account in Your Account.
You can close your account by emailing customerservice@tablethotels.com.
We will retain in your Your Account, the Personal Information of individuals for whom you have made reservations on your behalf. You can access or modify these third parties' Personal Information at any time.
We will retain your Personal Information in our databases in accordance with our Records Management Policy and applicable laws. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later. We may also need to retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity; protect ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain; or if we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.
Your Personal Information will be stored in secured locations and on servers controlled by Tablet, located either at our offices or at the offices of our service providers as described in "Protection of Information" below.
5.2. Protection of Personal Information
Tablet employs physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of Personal Information. When Personal Information is sent to our service providers, we require in our contracts with them that they protect all Personal Information in a manner consistent with the principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.
If you choose to contact Tablet through our Site, you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically via the World Wide Web might not be secure. Tablet assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to us via the World Wide Web. However, if you provide your credit card information on our Site's credit card forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
In communicating with you, we may send e-mail as unencrypted plain text because we are aware that most Members and Guests cannot readily process encrypted e-mail. This is done for your convenience, but with the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted e-mail.
5.3. Account Protection
Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and do not disclose your Tablet password to anyone. If you do share your password or your Personal Information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your Personal Information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify Tablet and change your password.
6. How to access or modify your Account
You can access your Personal Information in Your Account. You can change at any time your preferences for receiving or not receiving our e-mails and e-newsletters.
If you wish to modify your Personal Information or close your account, you can do so by contacting us as indicated in Contact Information. We will respond to such requests to information access within thirty (30) days following receipt at the e-mail or mailing address stated above. If we receive your request at a different e-mail or mailing address, we will respond within a reasonable period of time.
We do retain Personal Information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms and Conditions, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.
We may communicate with you at various times, with administrative emails or phone calls, about transactions and service announcements, customer service responses, and promotional emails like special offers, newsletters and updates. You can choose to stop receiving promotional emails at any time by simply using an email's unsubscribe function. You may not opt out of receiving administrative messages or customer service responses.
If you request that we close your account, we will promptly do so, to the extent possible. Once your account is closed, however, you will not be able to use many of the Services available on our Site to Members, unless you re-register.
Please remember that we may not be able to honor your request if we are legally obligated to retain information, or for other reasons described in "Storage, Retention and Protection of Personal Information" above.

You may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the sites that we do not control.
7.2. Third Party Advertisers
We work with third parties to serve ads on our Site and to serve ads on sites owned or operated by other companies. Our ad servers, and those of our partners, use cookies and pixel tags in order to anonymously identify your browser.

We do not use or share any Personal Information with any of our ad server partners, media partners or ad networks without your authorization.
We use anonymous Session Data, such as the destination of your search, in order to advertise to you on our Site and on other sites. We do not sell your Session Data to any other party in connection with our ad programs but we may use it in order to run ads on behalf of others, such as travel suppliers. If you wish to opt-out of this kind of advertising, you can click on the following link http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. None of our ad programs include any of your Personal Information. By opting out, you may still receive ads from Tablet or ads from other parties that are broadly targeted (not on the basis of your Session Data).

7.4. Monitoring
Tablet may from time to time monitor and review any information transmitted or received through our Site, or through telephone or e-mail communications, for quality assurance and other purposes. We reserve the right to censor, edit, remove or prohibit the transmission or receipt of any information that Tablet deems inappropriate or in violation of our Terms and Conditions. During monitoring the information may be examined, recorded or copied.
7.5. Third Parties
Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others on our sites or other sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Tablet does not control the privacy policies of third-parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your Personal Information to others.

If any proposed change is unacceptable to you, you may request that we close your account.
