Privacy Policy | TADS
The TADS Privacy Policy describes how we use and protect your customer information. We believe that protecting your privacy is an integral part of the customer service we provide to you.
In addition to our policy, we have multiple certifications and audits completed each year, including SOC 2 Type II, PCI Certification, extensive server testing and strict internal rules for our employees including Red Flags readiness.
TADS uses your information to provide the service with your school. School information is used only to provide the service. We never sell your information.
Keeping Your Information Safe and Secure
The TADS name is a trusted symbol of service and reliability. We are red flag certified to protect against identity theft.
Our dedicated, SSAE-16 audited, PCI and HIPAA-compliant physical hosting location utilizes keycard protocols, biometric scanning protocols, and around-the-clock interior and exterior surveillance. Access is limited to authorized data center personnel—no one can enter the production area without prior clearance and appropriate escort. Every data center employee undergoes thorough background security checks.
Unlike most companies, we simply will not trim costs by sharing compute resources with other services or putting our servers and software in the ‘cloud’. Our hardware and software is our own and access is limited to our personnel, our customers and network technicians.

We do not sell, give away or in any way disclose customer information to third parties.
We do not share customer information with outside parties who may wish to market their products to you.
