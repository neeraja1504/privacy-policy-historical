How your personal information is used by TalkTalk Telecom Limited
When you use the Web site at http://www.talktalkmembers.com/ we may ask you to provide certain information.
We may share your information with companies within the TalkTalk Group Limited group of companies and other carefully selected third parties for the purposes described in this policy and, in the event that we undergo re-organisation or are sold to a third party, you agree that your information may be transferred to that re-organised entity or third party. These purposes may include:
details you give us on application forms,
details you give us so that we can provide you with goods and services,
details you give us through use of our Web site.
You agree that we may use and update this centrally held information:
to provide you with other services;
to recover debts;
to prevent and detect fraud;
to update our records about you;
to prevent money laundering; and
to check your identity.
We may also use your information for research and statistical analysis with the aim of improving our services. If you request it, on payment of a fee, which is currently Â£10, we will provide you with a copy of the personal information to which you are entitled that we hold about you.
The information we hold about you is confidential. We will only disclose it outside the TalkTalk Group Limited group of companies when:
you give us your consent,
it is needed by certain reputable third parties involved in running accounts and/or providing services for you (for example, credit reference agencies who do credit checks for us),
in order to obtain professional advice,
we or others need to investigate or prevent crime (e.g. to fraud prevention agencies),
the law permits or requires it, or any regulatory or governmental body requests or requires it, even without your consent, or,
there is a duty to the public to reveal the information.
We may administer your account and provide other services from centres in countries outside Europe that do not always have the same standard of data protection laws as the UK. However, we will have a contract in place to ensure that your information is adequately protected, and we will remain bound by our obligations under the Data Protection Act even when your personal information is processed outside Europe.

Where children are specifically encouraged to participate on the Web site, they will always be advised that they should seek parental permission before they continue with the activity. We recommend that parents actively participate and where possible monitor their children's use of the internet and the Web site.
