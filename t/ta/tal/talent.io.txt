A Cookie is a small file sent by Talent – like many other internet services do – to the user’s browser which is then stored on the user’s device in order to recognize the user when the user revisits our Service the next time. Such Cookie usually contains the name of the domain the Cookie originates from, the durability of the Cookie until it expires, and a value in terms of a unique number generated by a respective random generator.
Using such Cookies enables Talent to recognize the user, and to statistically record the use of the service as well as analyze it in order to improve it.
You can disable Talent’s cookies on your browser as further described below, and the website can be accessed with cookies disabled, but the Service may not be usable or its usability deteriorated without cookies.
