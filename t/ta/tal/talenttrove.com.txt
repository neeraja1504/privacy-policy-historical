USE OF INFORMATION
Any visitor of the TalentTrove website can view your profile information and photos that you have uploaded to the TalentTrove community. You can control what part of your profile information and photos is visible to visitors of the TalentTrove website and which network of TalentTrove members can see what information.
To provide you with some of the features that the TalentTrove community offers to its members, we may use Personal Information that is stored in your profile after you have requested such features, for example to send invitation e-mails to people that you specified as being interested in joining the TalentTrove community. In order to provide useful information about social networks to people who might be interested in joining the TalentTrove community, we may use your profile information and photos on the TalentTrove website, when we send emails, or when we send general newsletters to members of the TalentTrove community. When you decide to view a member's profile, we may show that TalentTrove member that you chose to view their profile.
If you decide to use certain features of the TalentTrove network (like journals, blogs, groups, message boards and the like), some of the Personal Information you entered into your TalentTrove profile and any information, including Personal Information, that you enter using one of these features, might be used and displayed.
If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. TalentTrove stores this information to send this one-time email, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database.
TalentTrove may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, instant messaging services, and other users of the TalentTrove service through the operation of the service (e.g., photo tags) in order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience. TalentTrove members can use the search feature to search for other members by different criteria, like location or gender. The Personal Information that TalentTrove members enter into the TalentTrove profile will be used for these searches. Please be aware that any information that is publicly posted throughout the TalentTrove network can be accessed by every visitor of the Website.
TalentTrove may analyze any collected information for its own internal purposes. In addition, TalentTrove may remove personally identifying information from collected information to render it anonymous. TalentTrove may use Anonymous Information for any purpose and disclose Anonymous Information in its discretion.

We also provide information to third-party advertising companies, as described in the next section. Please be aware that the handling of your Personal Information by our partners, or the third-party advertising companies, is governed by their privacy policy, not ours.
If you would like to know (1) the categories of Personal Information about you that we disclosed in the prior calendar year to third parties for the purposes of the third parties marketing and/or (2) the names and addresses of such third parties, please contact us.
We will disclose information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may disclose information, if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected illegal activities or fraud, situations involving the physical safety of any person, violations of TalentTrove's terms of use, or as otherwise required by applicable law. If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements when you visit our Website.

PERSONAL INFORMATION CONNECT VIA TECHNOLOGY
As you navigate the Website, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system.

An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We track your IP Address when you login to the Website.

TalentTrove may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Website. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the Website may not work properly.
Other third parties may place advertisements and cookies on webpages within the TalentTrove network. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.
We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the TalentTrove service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the TalentTrove Newsletter, that are considered part of your TalentTrove account. If you would like to opt out of certain messages, log into TalentTrove and go to your account settings by clicking the account link in the top right hand corner.

We limit access to personal information about you to employees and third parties who we reasonably believe need access to that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you. Your TalentTrove account information is protected by a password that you select.

However, no company, including TalentTrove, can fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information.
