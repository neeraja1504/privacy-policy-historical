Delphi Forums Home
Your privacy is of the utmost importance to Delphi Forums. Because we ask for some basic personal information during registration, we want you to be fully informed of how this information is gathered and used.
Registration
Some basic personal information is required in order to register with Delphi Forums:
Name - Your first and last name help us to personalize your online experience. For example, your "My Forums" list of favorite online communities may feature your first and/or last name.
Email Address - By providing your email address, you can receive important messages via your existing email account. Message board notifications, personalized My Forums newsletters, and messages sent to you by other Delphi Forums members rely on the email address you provide when you register.
User Name - This is how you are identified when you participate in forums. While many other aspects of your account can be updated regularly, your user name cannot be changed.
Information Delphi Forums Requests
When you register, you are asked to give demographic information (like birth year, occupation, and gender). We ask you to tell us a little about yourself so we can better understand the types of people who register. This information can also be used to provide you with content that may be of interest to you, and to show you advertisements that are relevant to your demographic information. Delphi Forums uses outside ad companies to display ads on its sites. These ads may contain cookies. While Delphi Forums uses cookies in other parts of its sites, the ad companies also use cookies with the ads displayed, and Delphi Forums may not have access to this information.
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
No children under 13 are allowed to participate in Delphi Forums.
Participation
The above describes information that is provided "actively" - meaning, you choose to submit this information to us when you join Delphi Forums, or update your account at any point after having joined. Some other information is provided "passively" - meaning, that Delphi Forums obtains this information when you login to your Delphi account and use the service. This is done primarily through the use of "cookies." Cookies are used on Delphi Forums to verify your login information, and to optionally store your password in your browser so that you do not need to type it in each time you visit. Any time that you point your browser to a 'members-only' area, Delphi Forums checks your browser's cookie file to see if you have already logged in, and if you have, you're taken right to the page that you have requested. If not, you'll be directed to the Delphi Forums login screen, where you can quickly and easily login to your account, or signup for Delphi Forums if you are not yet a member. Cookies are also used in conjunction with some ad banners to determine their effectiveness.
Cookies
Delphi Forums uses cookies to customize your experience while using our services. A cookie is a small text file that many Web sites write through your browser when you visit them. A cookie can only be read by the site that places it, so Delphi Forums can't learn about your browsing history based on any other cookies in your browser. Most browsers also allow the option of displaying a warning before accepting a cookie, or refusing all cookies. Declining cookies while participating in forums may result in some of features not working properly.
Advertising
Delphi Forums uses third-party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve ads to you on our behalf when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you (if you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). Personally identifiable information such as your name, address, email address or telephone number are not shared with advertisers without your permission. We may use personally identifiable information in order to fill in forms on third-party sites we use to present advertising offers. But this information will not be shared and will not be stored by any third parties if you decline these offers.
Among the third-party advertising companies that Delphi Forums uses are Google and Advertising.com. For more information on their privacy policies, please consult the Google ad and content network privacy policy and the Advertising.com Privacy Policy.
Delphi Forums also uses technology from VigLink to augment links to certain online merchants. Please see the VigLink disclosure statement for more information.
Public Forums
Delphi Forums hosts message boards, chat and other services for both public and private forums. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in public forums becomes public information. In addition, information that is disclosed in private forums may be disclosed by other forum participants. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
Security
Delphi Forums' site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under its control. Delphi Forums' servers have strict security in place to prevent an intruder from retrieving personal information about its users.
Termination
You can elect to terminate your membership with Delphi Forums at any time. Simply go to your My Preferences page, scroll down to Account Status, and click the Close Account button. Upon termination, your account information will not necessarily be removed entirely from Delphi Forums - this is to reserve your identity so that no one else can create a new account with your membername or email address, and also allows you the privilege of reactivating your account at a later date if you wish to use Delphi Forums again. The termination of your Delphi Forums membership will not automatically terminate any affiliated memberships or registrations you have formed through Delphi Forums. If, after having joined a Delphi partner's service, you wish to be removed, you should contact that service directly to have your membership terminated.
Summary
In this electronic era, when personal information can easily be obtained through various sources, Delphi appreciates the sensitivity of any private information that you disclose to us. It is our intention to treat your account information with the highest level of care.
