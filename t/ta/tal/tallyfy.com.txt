Privacy Policy - Tallyfy
This Privacy Policy describes how Tallyfy collects, uses and discloses information, and what choices you have with respect to the information.
When we refer to “ Tallyfy ”, we mean the Tallyfy, Inc. entity that acts as the controller or processor of your information, as explained in more detail in the “Identifying the Data Controller and Processor” section below.
Applicability Of This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to Tallyfy’s online business process management tools and platform, including any associated Tallyfy mobile and desktop applications (collectively, the “ Services ”), Tallyfy.com and other Tallyfy websites (collectively, the “ Websites ”) and other interactions (e.g., customer service inquiries, user conferences, etc.) you may have with Tallyfy. If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the Services, Websites or any other aspect of Tallyfy’s business.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party applications or software that integrate with the Services through the Tallyfy platform (“ Third Party Services ”), or any other third party products, services or businesses. In addition, a separate agreement governs delivery, access and use of the Services (the “ Customer Agreement ”), including the processing of any messages, files or other content submitted through Services accounts (collectively, “ Customer Data ”). The organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Customer Agreement (“ Customer ”) controls their instance of the Services (their “ Workspace ”) and any associated Customer Data. If you have any questions about specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer whose Workspace you use. If you have received an invitation to join a Workspace but have not yet created an account, you should request assistance from the Customer that sent the invitation.
Information We Collect And Receive
Tallyfy may collect and receive Customer Data and other information and data (“ Other Information ”) in a variety of ways:
Customer Data. Customers or individuals granted access to a Workspace by a Customer (“ Authorized Users ”) routinely submit Customer Data to Tallyfy when using the Services.
Other Information. Tallyfy also collects, generates and/or receives Other Information:
Workspace and Account Information. To create or update a Workspace account, you or your Customer (e.g., your employer) supply Tallyfy with an email address, phone number, password, domain and/or similar account details. For details on Workspace creation, click here. In addition, Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services provide Tallyfy (or its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information and/or a billing address.
Usage Information.
Services Metadata. When an Authorized User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the way Authorized Users work. For example, Tallyfy logs the Workspaces, templates, processes, people, features, content and links you interact with, the types of files shared and what Third Party Services are used (if any).
Log data. As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services and record it in log files. This log data may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data.
Device information. Tallyfy collects information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this Other Information often depends on the type of device used and its settings.
Location information. We receive information from you, your Customer and other third-parties that helps us approximate your location. We may, for example, use a business address submitted by your employer, or an IP address received from your browser or device to determine approximate location. Tallyfy may also collect location information from devices in accordance with the consent process provided by your device.
Cookie Information. Tallyfy uses cookies and similar technologies in our Websites and Services that help us collect Other Information. The Websites and Services may also include cookies and similar tracking technologies of third parties, which may collect Other Information about you via the Websites and Services and across other websites and online services.
Third Party Services. Customer can choose to permit or restrict Third Party Services for their Workspace. Typically, Third Party Services are software that integrate with our Services, and Customer can permit its Authorized Users to enable and disable these integrations for their Workspace. Once enabled, the provider of a Third Party Service may share certain information with Tallyfy. For example, if a cloud storage application is enabled to permit files to be imported to a Workspace, we may receive user name and email address of Authorized Users, along with additional information that the application has elected to make available to Tallyfy to facilitate the integration. Authorized Users should check the privacy settings and notices in these Third Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to Tallyfy. When a Third Party Service is enabled, Tallyfy is authorized to connect and access Other Information made available to Tallyfy in accordance with our agreement with the Third Party Provider. We do not, however, receive or store passwords for any of these Third Party Services when connecting them to the Services.
Contact Information. In accordance with the consent process provided by your device, any contact information that an Authorized User chooses to import (such as an address book from a device) is collected when using the Services.
Third Party Data. Tallyfy may receive data about organizations, industries, Website visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters related to our business from parent corporation(s), affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful. This data may be combined with Other Information we collect and might include aggregate level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to zip codes or countries. Or it might be more specific: for example, how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.
Additional Information Provided to Tallyfy. We receive Other Information when submitted to our Websites or if you participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, apply for a job, request support, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with Tallyfy.
Generally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide any Customer Data or Other Information (collectively, “ Information ”). However, certain Information is collected automatically and, if some Information, such as Workspace setup details, is not provided, we may be unable to provide the Services.
