First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site, and to monitor aggregate usage by users and web traffic routing on the Site. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.

From time to time employees may examine this content or other user behavior to confirm that the terms of service are not being breached. When you send email or other communication to Taltopia, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. We will not send you marketing emails directly from Taltopia if you use the unsubscribe link in a previous email. However Taltopia may share your information with our web advertising partners.

If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Taltopia Sites at any time or in any manner.
