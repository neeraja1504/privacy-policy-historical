Privacy Policy
MiraGame (Miracle Castle / Xingwan) is dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of our users. This Privacy Policy describes the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information you provide in connection with our website at www.MiraGame.com or any MiraGame’s game or application provided on other websites or other third party sources. Please note that the scope of this Privacy Policy is limited to information collected by MiraGame through your use of the service.
By using the service, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are responsible for periodically reading this Privacy Policy. If you use our service after we have updated this Privacy Policy, you acknowledge that you have read the updated terms and consent to our revised privacy practices. Use of the service after changes are made to the Privacy Policy will be considered your consent to the new terms.
Information Collected and Used
MiraGame's primary objective in collecting user information is to provide and enhance the service and to enable users to easily navigate and enjoy the service. MiraGame may use user information to analyze user behavior in MiraGame’s games. For example, MiraGame may analyze user information to determine how often a user plays a particular game, if a user purchases premium goods and other similar events.
We may collect both Personal and Non-Personal Information. Personal Information is defined as information about you that can be used to contact or identify you such as your name, email address, home address, and phone number. Personal Information does not include aggregate information, which is data we collect about the characteristics and activities of users of the service, from which any Personal Information has been removed. Non-Personal Information does not identify you personally and can include age, gender or interests. We may combine Personal Information with Non-Personal Information and use this combination to improve your experience or to aggregate it with information collected from other users to improve or analyze our service. This privacy policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information or of Non-Personal Information.
You provide us information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail address, if you register for a game account on our website. When you visit our website, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets MiraGame help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.

Links and Third Party Tools
The service may contain links to other websites. The fact that the service links to a website or presents a banner ad or other type of advertisement does not mean that MiraGame endorses or authorizes that third party, nor is it a representation of our affiliation with that third party.

If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring information, including Personally Information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. and the use and disclosure of information about you, including Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.
