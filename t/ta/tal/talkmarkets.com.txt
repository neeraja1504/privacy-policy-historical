INFORMATION GATHERED AND TRACKED BY TALKMARKETS
We gather two types of data about our users: personal information and tracking information.
PERSONAL INFORMATION
Personal information is provided by users when registering on TalkMarkets.com as a user of TalkMarkets.com, when registering as a subscriber to one of our email alerts, when registering as a contributor, and voluntarily at certain other points, such as entering contests, completing surveys or otherwise. You may enter your information on our site, but if you prefer, you may talk offline to a customer service representative and provide the required information by email at support [@] talkmarkets.com.

However, if you would like to use certain features, such as customizing your browising experience, following authors or members, or commenting on articles, we require you to register to become a member.
In order to register, you will have to supply us with your email address and choose a unique User Name and Password. You will be required to verify your email address by clicking on the activation link in the Welcome Letter that will be sent to you upon your submission of a completed registrationform.
OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTION:
Portfolio - We may provide a free portfolio tool which registered members of TalkMarkets can use to stay current on stocks in their portfolio. Participant's have the option to keep their portfolio information private or to share this content with other users of similar interests.
Content - We may offer articles, blogs, videos, podcasts or other information featuring commentary by our contributors. These allow subscribers to respond to a writer's commentary or to another subscriber's post. We urge and encourage participants posting comments on the blogs to include their full name in any comment and to disclose any positions held in securities they discuss in any comment. Please note that information submitted will be available for any user to read, and is no longer private.
Surveys/Polls - At certain times, you may be asked to participate in surveys, which are generally aimed at obtaining general information, for example, your investment experience or your reaction to a particular article. Because information obtained in these surveys is connected with individual subscribers and is used internally or by third-party partners to better market our services, participation is voluntary. In addition, some columnists will on occasion take polls of their readers. Such polls are solely for the editorial use of the individual columnists, and participation is voluntary.
Contests and Sweepstakes - We may offer contests or sweepstakes in which certain personal information is required for registration, for purposes of verifying the entrants' identities and notifying the winners. If the contest or sweepstakes is being administered or sponsored by a third party, this information will be disclosed to that third party. However, entrants may select contest names distinct from their User Names, and the information is not connected with their User Names.
TRACKING INFORMATION
Tracking information is automatically collected about all visitors to TalkMarrkets.com. This information consists of both individual and aggregated tracking information and is automatically gathered using "cookies." A cookie is a small data file containing information, such as a user's login name, that is written to the user's hard drive by a web server and used to track the pages visited. We use cookies in several ways to track user behavior. Cookies store visitors' preferences and past activity on our site and other websites in order to provide better service to our visitors. The information we gather on an individual basis is used for advertising and internal purposes, such as accessing a member's account information. We also use tracking information on an aggregate basis, to track the readership of stories and usage of our products, to analyze traffic patterns on our sites, and to provide anonymous reporting of usage for internal and external clients. In all cases, cookies used by TalkMarkets.com are encoded and contain a unique digital signature to prevent tampering. They do not contain user passwords. We also employ technology that is commonly referred to as "action tags" (also known as "web beacons," "scripts" or "one pixel .gif files") to measure the effectiveness of our advertisements.
