Your IP (Internet Protocol) address, which may be associated with an Internet Service Provider and country of residence
The name and version of the browser you are connecting with (User-Agent string)
The page or resource you are requesting
This information is not shared with third parties, except if you consent to disclosure or we are required by law to disclose this information. Your IP address may be logged and used to identify you for administrative purposes, such as revoking access to abusive users. It may also be used in aggregation of anonymous statistics. Your browser's name and version number (User-Agent string) may be used to provide content best suited for your device, in the case of resources which have multiple representations.
Cookies
Certain information, such as authentication tokens used to identify your account after logging in, and your theme preference are stored in "cookies" on your browser. This information is sent to TaimaTV's servers automatically when you request a page. The login cookie is used to verify your identity with respect to your account, and the theme cookie is used to present the page using your preferred theme. Neither cookie is explicitly shared with third parties, however it is possible they may be observed by an intermediary, especially if you are browsing on an insecure network.
localStorage
Information about your website preferences, such as those configurable from the Options dialog on a channel page, is stored in your browser via the HTML5 localStorage interface. This information is used to persist your desired settings across multiple sessions on the website. This information is not explicitly shared with third parties, however any entity which has access to your browser, including userscripts, may read or modify it.

Account Information
In order to register an account, you must provide the following information:
A username, which uniquely identifies the account
A password
Your username and password will be stored on TaimaTV's servers and used for the purposes of authentication.

An email address

A brief profile summary (text)
All of this information is stored on TaimaTV's servers. Your email address will only be used for the purposes of verifying your identity in case you are unable to login to your account. It is not shared with third parties, nor will it be used to communicate arbitrary information to you. Your profile image and summary are visible publicly.
