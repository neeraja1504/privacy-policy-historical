Use of Facebook Social Plugins
This website uses so-called social plugins ("plugins") from the social network Facebook, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook"). The plugins are identified by a Facebook logo or the words "social plug-in from Facebook" and "Facebook Social Plugin". An overview of the Facebook plug-ins, and their appearance can be found here.
If you request a page of our website that contains a social plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is directly transmitted from Facebook to your browser and from that incorporated in the website.
By integrating the plugin Facebook receives the information that your browser has accessed the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have a Facebook account or are not currently logged in to Facebook. This information (including your IP address) is transmitted from your browser directly to a Facebook server in the USA and stored there.
If you are logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign your visit to our site directly to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, for example, press the "Like" button or leave a comment, the corresponding information is also transmitted directly to a Facebook server and stored there. The information will also be posted on Facebook and will be visible to your Facebook friends.
Facebook can use this information for purposes of advertising, market research and custom design of the Facebook pages. For this purpose, Facebook creates usage, interest and relationship profiles, eg to evaluate your use of our website in terms of the appearance of Facebook Ads displayed to you, inform other Facebook users about your activities on our website and to provide other associated service connected with the use of Facebook.
If you do not want Facebook to connect the collected data about our website to your Facebook account, you must log out from Facebook before you visit our site.
For further information about the purpose and scope of data collection and the further processing and use of data by Facebook, and your rights and ways to protect your privacy, please see the privacy notices of Facebook.
