What Information we collect
We collect a range of information from our customers that is directly related to the products and services you choose. Where we wish to use the information for other purposes we will seek your agreement beforehand. The kind of personal information we collect can include: name, contact details, location, demographic information like gender, age, relationship status and so on, products you are interested in, where you shop, what you buy, who you shop for, where else you like to shop, what loyalty programs you belong to.
How We Collect Information
As much as possible we collect information directly from our customers. We do this in a number of ways, including when you:
provide us with personal information over the phone or through personal mobile computing devices, like smart phones and tablets;
fill out application forms; or
submit your personal details through our website.
We also collect solicited personal information indirectly, through publicly available sources, or through social media sites, like Facebook, Twitter, Google and others, who disclose to their users that the users’ personal information is provided to businesses like Target. We may also collect or have access to personal information through our related companies such as Coles Group Limited. We do this where:
the customer has consented to such collection or would reasonably expect us to collect their personal information in this way, or
if it is necessary for a specific purpose such as the investigation of a privacy complaint
We usually only retain unsolicited information about our customers when dealing with a customer enquiry or complaint or where we conduct an investigation. For example, your image may be present on CCTV footage that also records a fall of another customer in one of our Stores.
