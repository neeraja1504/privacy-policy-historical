Do Not Track

Tacx will only share your personal information with third parties if:
Tacx has your consent;
Tacx deems this necessary to provide you with the Tacx Service. All companies are contractually engaged in providing us with services like the purchase of products and services, email management and payment processing.
Tacx determines that it is required to do so by law; such as in response to a court order or subpoena;
Tacx finds that you are in breach of its terms and conditions or any of its policies or usage guidelines for specific Tacx Services;
it is necessary in Tacx’s opinion to do so to prevent, investigate, detect or prosecute criminal offenses or attacks on the technical integrity of the Site or Tacx’s network;
it is necessary in Tacx’s opinion to do so to protect the rights, property, or safety of Tacx or its employees, the users of the Tacx Service, or the public; or
information about you and your use of the Tacx Service may be aggregated with other information collected via the Tacx Service or otherwise used in ways that do not personally identify you or constitute personally identifiable information. This type of aggregated or statistical information may be used by us to improve the quality of the Tacx Service or for other purposes that we may deem appropriate.
Our processing of your personal information will be legitimized as follows:
Whenever we require your consent for the processing of your personal information such processing will be justified pursuant to Article 6(1) lit. (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”). This article in the GDPR describes when processing can be done lawfully.

Transferring personal data from the EU to the US
Information we collect from you may be processed in the United States through our Software (Google Cloud Platform). The United States has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the GGDPR. A finding of “adequacy” in short means that the European Commission has decided that this country outside the European Economic Area (“Area”) ensures an adequate level of data protection. We refer, to https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/eu-data-protection/ for more information on the safeguards that Google has in place for the transfer the Google Cloud Platform.
What can I do to help make sure the security works correctly?
Tacx uses bcrypt algorithms to “hash” passwords of users, Tacx does not store its user’s passwords. “Hashing” is the transformation of a string of characters into a value or key, it is a form of encryption. Tacx also uses SSL. The data traffic to the Software (Cloud) is protected by SSL, this also protects the data traffic between the Apps and the Cloud. SSL is a technique used to encrypt the connection between data traffic between for example a website and a server.
To help ensure that these measures are effective in preventing unauthorized access to your private information, you should be aware of the security features available to you through your browser. You should use a security-enabled browser to submit your credit card information and other personal information at the Site or any other Tacx Service. Please note: If you do not use a SSL-capable browser, you are at risk for having data intercepted. Tacx will not be responsible for any compromise of data that is intercepted due to your use of an unsecured browser.
Most browsers have the ability to notify you if you change between secure and insecure communications, receive invalid site identification information for the site you are communicating with, or send information over an unsecured connection. Tacx recommends that you enable these browser functions to help ensure that your communications are secure. You can also monitor the URL of the site you are visiting (secure URLs begin with https:// rather than the normal http://), along with the security symbol of your browser (an open or closed padlock in Netscape or a broken or complete key in Internet Explorer) to help identify when you are communicating with a secure server. You can also view the details of the security certificate of the site to which you are connected. Tacx encourages you to use this to check the validity of any site you connect to using secure communications.
Tacx uses reasonable physical, technical and administrative measures to safeguard personal information you provide through the Tacx Service or in connection with Tacx’s Products and Services.  Please be aware that no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Third parties
The Tacx Service allows for direct interaction with external social networks or other external platform that are outside our control. The interaction and information obtained by the Tacx Service are always subject to the user’s privacy settings for each social network. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by other websites or other services. Information collected by third parties, which may include such aspects as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices. You should exercise caution, and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use. The following third parties may be used by the Tacx Service. We have tried to include an overview that is as complete as possible on all third parties, however, we cannot guarantee the truthfulness and completeness of this overview.
Users can sign in to the Cloud using Google, Facebook or a dedicated Tacx Account. Both Google and Facebook accounts are connected via OAuth2 (OAuth2 is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts) web flows of Google and Facebook. Tacx accounts are handled completely by the Tacx Account backend. Users can also connect their Strava account to their Cloud account (this is part of the Software), the connection is also made via an OAuth2 web flow.
Google Analytics
Google analytics gathers anonymous user data. In particular, it gathers the following data and provides it (anonymously and aggregated) to Tacx:
Numbers of users per age group;
Numbers of male users;
Numbers of female users;
Number of users per country;
Number of users per device;
Number of users per device operating system version:
Number of users per users interest group;
Number of active users;
Time users spend daily;
Whether or not users have made a purchase.
Firebase
Firebase is used to collect data on errors in Android and iPhone Apps. Firebase and Fabric’s crash analytics track the failures in the Apps. Such error messages always contain a UUID, which is a 128-bit number used to identify information in computer systems, email and full name. Theoretically, error messages may contain more user information that the user entered into the App or gave access to when signing in with Facebook, Google, or by linking Strava.
_OAuth2 Account Connections
_For each Google, Facebook, and Strava connection, the user has to confirm if he or she wants to share the data that the Software requests with the Software. The user can deny these requests, effectively disabling the connection. When making the connection the Software sends a scope to the OAuth2 provider in question which contains all the information it requests. The scope is as follows:
Facebook: email and public profile.
Google: email and profile.
Strava: write, full reading and writing rights to Strava account of the user.
Mandrill
Mandrill is used to send emails to specific users. Mandrill contains templates defined by Tacx for several types of email. These are currently two types of email: TCX Export and Password Reset. These templates require the first name of the user and for sending, obviously, the email of the user is required. These data are provided by the Software or account backends. Further data required by these templates is generated by either the account backend or the Software backend. The actual content as it is sent to the user is stored in Mandrill for later reference. In the future, new types of email may require other use of data, logically this data will be provided by the account backend or the Software backend from their storage systems. For sending emails to single users, Tacx uses Mandrill. Some user data is synchronized with Tacx’s MailChimp account for use in the Tacx newsletter.
MailChimp
MailChimp is used for sending newsletters to users, the Software synchronizes with Tacx’ MailChimp account. The Software backend synchronizes, from its data store, the following data with MailChimp: first name, last name, email address, language.
