Data Retention Policy
Managing Document and Personal Data Retention
Updated as of:  Aug. 1, 2018
AthlonOutdoors.com, Tactical-Life.com, PersonalDefenseWorld.com, BallisticMag.com, and RealWorldSurvivor.com (collectively, “ Athlon ,” “ we ,” “ us ,” or “ our ”), have published this Data Retention Policy to inform our users, customers, and website visitors from the European Economic Area (collectively, “ Data Subjects ”) about how Athlon processes and retains specific categories of Personal Data (as described below), our retention periods for their Personal Data, our reasoning behind those retention periods, and the minimum standards to be applied when destroying certain types of information within Athlon.
Purpose and Scope :
Under the terms of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “ GDPR ”), Athlon is required to process Personal Data from Data Subjects in a fair manner which notifies Data Subjects of the purposes of the data processing and also to retain the Personal Data for no longer than is necessary to achieve those purposes.
Under these rules, Data Subjects have a right to be informed about how their Personal Data is processed and this policy is meant to provide Data Subjects with information on our data retention periods or criteria used to determine the retention periods.
This policy applies to all business units, processes, and systems in all countries in which we conduct business and have dealings or other business relationships with third parties. This policy applies to all Athlon officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, contractors, consultants, advisors, or service providers who may collect, process, or have access to data (including Personal Data and/or Sensitive Personal Data, as those terms are defined below). It is the responsibility of all of the above persons to familiarize themselves with this policy and ensure adequate compliance with it.
This policy applies to all records used and maintained at Athlon, regardless of physical format, including:
·       Appointment books and calendars | ·       Invoices
---|---
·       Audio and video recordings | ·       Letters and other correspondence
·       Computer programs | ·       Magnetic tape
·       Contracts | ·       Memory in mobile phones and PDAs
·       Electronic files | ·       Online postings, including social media platforms
·       E-mails | ·       Performance reviews
·       Handwritten notes | ·       Voicemails
Please see the Records Retention Schedule contained in Appendix A to this policy for the amount of time that any paper records and electronic files will be retained by Athlon. A record must not be retained beyond the Retention Period indicated in the Record Retention Schedule, unless a valid business reason (or a litigation hold or other special situation) calls for its continued retention.
For questions on document retention or if you are unsure whether to retain a certain record, contact our Data Protection Officer (“ DPO ”), Matt Hogan, at mhogan@athlonoutdoors.com.
Definitions :
“ Personal Data ” means any information relating, directly or indirectly, to an identified or identifiable Data Subject, including name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.
“ Sensitive Personal Data ” means any Personal Data that reveals racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.
“ Operational Personal Data ” means any Personal Data that is used by Athlon for the purpose of operating its systems and services, including, but not limited to, internal identifiers that Athlon’s systems and/or services use as references for or to leads, events, clicks, or actions performed by users, customers, and/or website visitors.
“ Metric Personal Data ” means any Personal Data that is used by Athlon for the purpose of measuring the performance of its systems and services or the systems and services of Athlon’s users, customers, and/or website visitors.
“ Marketing Personal Data ” means any Personal Data that is used by Athlon or Athlon’s users, customers, and/or website visitors solely for marketing purposes.
“ Contract Duration ” is the length of time from the date a contract or agreement is executed between Athlon and any users, customers, website visitors, or relevant third party and the date that such contract or agreement is terminated.
“ Retention Period ” is the length of time between the expiration of the Contract Duration and the time when the Personal Data is purged. If the Retention Period is described as “Permanent,” the data type is held indefinitely.
Document Retention Procedure :
As a company, Athlon is required to retain certain records, usually for a specific amount of time. We must retain these records because they contain information that:
Serves as Athlon’s corporate memory
Have enduring business value (for example, they provide a record of a business transaction, evidence Athlon’s rights or obligations, protect our legal interests, or ensure operational continuity
Must be kept in order to satisfy legal, accounting, or other regulatory requirements
We must balance these requirements with our statutory obligation to only keep records for the period required and to comply with data minimization principles. Our DPO determines the time period for which the documents and electronic records should to be retained. If there is no justification for retaining Personal Data, then those records should be routinely deleted. Information should never be kept “just in case” a use can be found for it in the future. If we want to retain information about Data Subjects to help us to provide better service in the future, we will obtain consent in advance.
Further retention of Personal Data is lawful only when compatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected. In some cases, no separate legal basis will be required — for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in Athlon as a data controller; on the grounds of public interest in the area of public health; for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, or historical research or statistical purposes; or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
Erasure of Personal Data :
On a regular basis, we review all data, whether held electronically or on paper, to decide whether to destroy or delete any data once the purpose for which those documents were created is no longer relevant. Overall responsibility for the destruction of data falls to our DPO.
Once a timing decision is made to dispose Personal Data (see Records Retention Schedule contained in Appendix A ), the information is deleted, shredded, or otherwise destroyed to a degree proportionate to the information’s value to others and level of confidentiality. Thus, the method of disposal varies and is dependent upon the nature of the document. For example, any documents that contain Sensitive Personal Data shall be disposed of as confidential waste (cross-cut shredded and incinerated; secure electronic deletion); some expired or superseded contracts may only warrant in-house shredding. The Records Retention Schedule defines the mode of disposal. The specific deletion or destruction process may be carried out either by an employee or by an internal or external service provider that the DPO subcontracts for this purpose, but the DPO shall fully document and approve the destruction process.
Appropriate controls shall be in place that prevent the permanent loss of essential information as a result of malicious or unintentional destruction of information — these controls are described further in our Privacy Policy.
Records which may be routinely destroyed, unless subject to an on-going legal or regulatory inquiry, are:
(Generally, these types of records have no significant operational, informational, or evidential value;   contain information that is duplicated, unimportant or only of a short-term value; and contain little or no Personal Data from Data Subjects. They can therefore be destroyed as soon as they have served their primary purpose)
Announcements and notices of day-to-day meetings and other events
Requests for ordinary information, such as travel directions
Reservations for internal meetings
Transmission documents, such as fax cover sheets and routing slips that accompany documents, but do not add substantive value
Superseded address lists, distribution lists, etc.
Duplicate documents such as CC and FYI copies, unaltered drafts, snapshot printouts, or extracts from databases and day files
Stock in-house publications which are obsolete or superseded
Trade magazines, vendor catalogues, flyers, and newsletters from vendors or other external organizations
In all cases, disposal is subject to any disclosure requirements which may exist in the context of litigation.
Right of Erasure :
Where the Personal Data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is/was collected or otherwise processed
Where a Data Subject has withdrawn his/her consent or objects to the processing of Personal Data
Where the processing of Personal Data does not otherwise comply with the GDPR
Breach, Enforcement, and Compliance ** **
The DPO has the responsibility of ensuring that Athlon’s employees comply with this policy.  It is also the responsibility of the DPO to assist with official inquiries from any data protection and/or governmental authority. Any suspicion of a breach of this policy must be reported immediately to DPO. All instances of suspected breaches of this policy shall be investigated and action taken, as appropriate.
Failure to comply with this policy may result in adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, loss of customer confidence, litigation and loss of competitive advantage, financial loss, damage to Athlon’s reputation, and personal injury, harm, or loss. Non-compliance with this policy by permanent, temporary or contract employees or any third parties, who have been granted access to Athlon’s premises or information may therefore result in disciplinary proceedings or termination of employment or contract. Such non-compliance may also lead to legal action against the parties involved in such activities.
Appendix A :   Records Retention Schedule **      **
Record Name/Type | Storage Location | Responsibility for Storage | Controls for Record Protection | Retention Period | Destruction Level**
---|---|---|---|---|---
[i.e. Subscription Orders] |  | [i.e. Accounting Dept.; DPO] |  |  | [i.e. Level II]
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
** ** Destruction Levels**
Level I documents are those that contain information that is of the highest security and confidentiality and those that include any Personal Data, especially Sensitive Personal Data. These documents shall be disposed of as confidential waste (cross-cut shredded and incinerated) and shall be subject to secure electronic deletion. Disposal of the documents should include proof of destruction.
Level II documents are proprietary documents that contain confidential information, such as parties’ names, signatures, and addresses, or which could be used by third parties to commit fraud, but which may not contain any Personal Data. The documents should be cross-cut shredded and then placed into locked garbage containers for collection by an approved disposal firm, and electronic documents will be subject to secure electronic deletion.

Personal data will be collected and processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
If you would like information on how we process personal data via cookies, social plugins, and other types of tracking technology, please also refer to our Cookie Policy.
We will only share your personal data with third parties in the circumstances set out below. We will always comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (“ GDPR ”) when dealing with Data Subjects’ personal data. Further details on GDPR can be found on the website of the Information Commissioner (www.ico.gov.uk).
We reserve the right to amend this policy from time to time without prior notice.
Overview of Data Protection :
GDPR requires that Athlon, acting either as a data controller (meaning an individual or organization which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data) or as a data processor (meaning an individual or organization which processes personal data on behalf of the data controller),  process data in accordance with certain principles of data protection:
Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner;
Personal data must be collected for specified and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes;
The personal data collected must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed;
The personal data collected must be accurate and kept up-to-date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, bearing in mind the purpose(s) for which it is processed, is erased or rectified without delay;
The personal data collected must be kept for no longer than is necessary for the purpose(s) for which the personal data is processed;
The personal data collected must be processed with appropriate security measures, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures; and that
The data controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate, compliance with these principles.
Data Protection Officer :
For the purposes of the GDPR, our Data Protection Officer (the “DPO”) will be Matt Hogan (mhogan@athlonoutdoors.com). The DPO is responsible for making sure that Athlon complies with the GDPR requirements for handling the personal data of Data Subjects. We will regularly review all our holdings of personal data to establish our compliance. ** **
Data Subject Rights :
Data Subjects have rights under the GDPR, including:
The right to request access to all personal data relating to you that is processed by us in a structured, commonly-used, and machine-readable format. However, we reserve the right to charge an administrative fee for multiple subsequent requests for access that are clearly submitted for the purpose of causing us nuisance or harm.
The right to ask that any personal data relating to you that is inaccurate is corrected free of charge. If you submit a request for correction, such request must be accompanied by proof of the accuracy of the correction you are seeking.
The right to withdraw previously-granted consent for the processing of your personal data. You have the right to oppose the processing of personal data if you are able to prove that there are serious and justified reasons connected with the particular circumstances that warrant such opposition. However, if the intended processing qualifies as direct marketing, you have the right to oppose such processing free of charge and without justification.
the right to request that personal data relating to you be deleted if it is no longer required in light of the purposes outlined in this policy or, where we rely on your consent as the legal basis for processing, when you withdraw your consent for processing. Please keep in mind that a request for deletion will be evaluated against our overriding interests or those of any other third party and any legal or regulatory obligations or administrative or judicial orders which may contradict such deletion. Instead of deletion, you can also ask that we limit the processing of your personal data if and when: (a) you contest the accuracy of the data, (b) the processing is illegitimate, or (c) the data is no longer needed for the purposes listed in this policy.
If you wish to submit a request to exercise one or more of the rights listed above, or to address any questions, comments, or requests about our data processing practices, you can send an e-mail to our DPO at mhogan@athlonoutdoors.com. An e-mail requesting to exercise a right shall not be construed as consent to the processing of your personal data beyond what is required for handling your request. Any request should be dated and clearly state which right you wish to exercise and the reasons for it, if such is required. The circumstances may mean we need to undertake verification of your identity before we action your request in order to protect your personal data to the relevant standard. We will promptly inform you of having received this request. If the request proves valid, we will action it as soon as reasonably possible and at the latest thirty (30) days after having received the request.
For more details describing the rights of Data Subjects with regards to personal data, please see our Privacy Policy.
Lawful Reasons for Processing Personal Data :
Athlon will only process personal data where it has a legal basis for doing so (see Annex A attached). Where Athlon does not have a legal reason for processing personal data, any processing will be a breach of the terms of GDPR.
For processing your personal data for the purposes outlined this policy and our Privacy Policy, we, as the responsible party, ask for your consent. The processing of your personal data for these purposes is also necessary for the protection of our legitimate interest in marketing and promoting our products, services, and brands and the overall successful commercialization of our products and services. The processing of personal data for these purpose is also necessary for the protection of our legitimate interest to continuously improve our websites, social media channels, products, and services to ensure that you have the best experience possible. Finally, the processing of personal data is necessary to allow us to comply with our legal obligations and for the protection of our legitimate interest in keeping our websites, social media channels, products, and services safe from misuse and illegal activity.
Before transferring personal data to any third party, Athlon will establish that we have a legal reason for making the transfer. We will make a reasonable effort to ensure that your personal data is shared only with organizations that are GDPR compliant in those instances where we have your consent to sharing with third parties or are otherwise permitted by law to do so.
Protecting Personal Data and the Rights of Data Subjects :
Your personal data is only processed for as long as needed to achieve the lawful purposes described in this policy and in our Privacy Policy. We may de-identify your personal data when it is no longer necessary for those purposes, unless there is:
An overriding interest of Athlon, your financial institution, the payment service provider, or another third party, in keeping your personal data identifiable; or
A legal or regulatory obligation or a judicial or administrative order that prevents us from de-identifying.
You understand that an essential aspect of our marketing efforts involves making our marketing materials more relevant to you. This means that we collect personal data in order to provide you with communications, promotions, offerings, newsletters, and other advertisements about products and services that may interest you. We will take appropriate technical and organizational measures to keep your personal data safe from unauthorized access or theft, as well as accidental loss, tampering, or destruction. Access by our personnel or our third party processors will be on a need-to-know basis and will be subject to strict confidentiality obligations. You understand, however, that safety and security are best-efforts obligations which can never be guaranteed.
If you are registered to receive communications, promotions, offerings, newsletters, and other advertisements via e-mail or other person-to-person electronic communication channels, you can change your preferences for receiving such communications, promotions, offerings, newsletters and other advertisements by [ following the opt-out link provided in such communications / emailing us ataohelp@athlonoutdoors.com.
Your personal data will normally be kept for up to [_____ years]. It may be kept for a longer period for reasons such as legal action or required management. For more information on our retention of personal data, please see our Data Retention Policy.
Reporting Personal Data Breaches :
All data breaches should be referred immediately to the DPO, Matt Hogan, at mhogan@athlonoutdoors.com.
Where Athlon has identified a personal data breach resulting in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of any Data Subject, we shall alert all affected Data Subjects without undue delay. Athlon may not be required to tell Data Subjects about a personal data breach where:
We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational protection measures to the personal data affected by the breach, in particular to make the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorized to access it, such as encryption.
We have taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of the Data Subject is no longer likely to materialize.
It would involve disproportionate effort to tell all affected Data Subjects. In this case, Athlon will make a public communication or similar measure to tell all affected Data Subjects.
If you have a complaint or suggestion about the handling of personal data, please contact our DPO, whose details are listed above.
