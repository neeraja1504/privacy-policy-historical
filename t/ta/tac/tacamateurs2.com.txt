We take your privacy very seriously. It is important that you know what information TACNet Ltd (known here as 'we') collect and how we use it.

What Information we collect
We collect information when you join one of our website(s). Typically this includes your name, email address, IP address, username, password and whether the transaction with our billing processor was successful or was declined. We do NOT store your credit card or address details.
When someone visits our websites we use a third party service, Google Analytics, to collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behavior patterns. This tells us how many visitors come to the various parts of the website. The method of processing this information does not enable Google Analytics to indentify anyone and we do not permit Google to try and find out the identities of visitors to our site.
Google Analytics only provides us with generalised 'quantity' information such as how people visit each page on the website and how long they stay on a page. This information allows us to keep our website relevant and appealing to all customer and visitors.
How we use the information we collect
We use the information we collect to provide the website(s) including transaction processing and authentication when you login. We use your information to verify accounts and activity, to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of Service policies.
When you join one of our website(s), we may use your email address to send you further information about updates and/or other websites we operate. You can remove yourself from our email list at any time by clicking the link at the bottom of the email.
We use cookies to develop our website(s) and to provide you with the best possible user experience.
How we store and secure your information ?
We endeavour to take all reasonable steps to protect your data. All the data collected by us is stored on a secure server in a secure hosting facility in the United States and we take all reasonable steps to ensure all access is pre-authorised and recorded.
Do we share your information ?
