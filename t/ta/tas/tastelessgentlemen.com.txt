Privacy Policy
Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy.
Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we will identify the purposes for which information is being collected.
We will collect and use of personal information solely with the objective of fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other compatible purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.
We will only retain personal information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes.
We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned.
Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.
We will protect personal information by reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.
We will make readily available to customers information about our policies and practices relating to the management of personal information.
We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal information is protected and maintained.
Editorial Rules
We reserve the right to edit any and all content as needed, for any reason, at any time.
Values on Politics, Content, and Overall Experience
All voices and opinions are welcome. Everyone has their own views and are welcome to share them on TTG. Remember that not everyone has the same views, so be respectful to each other and engage in friendly debate within comment sections if you please.
It’s OK to disagree with people while engaging in meaningful conversation.
We wish to provide fun, factual, and conversational content to give readers an enjoyable user experience with content worth sharing.
Write something amazing filled with facts and useful information and it will perform much better. Articles with no facts or personality will perform poorly or may not be approved. If you tell a great story, then people will share it.
