Personal Information
“ Personal Information ,” as used in this Policy, is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual’s name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. Personal Information also includes information about an individual’s activities, such as information about his or her activity on our Service, and demographic information, such as gender, geographic area, and preferences, when any of this information is linked to Personal Information that identifies that individual.
Personal Information does not include “aggregate” or other non-personal information. Aggregate information is information that we collect about a group or category of products, services, or users that is not personally identifiable or from which individual identities are removed. We may use and disclose aggregate information, and other non-personal information, for various purposes
Although information uploaded to the Service by a Taskworld enterprise customer for processing (“ Customer Data “) may include information that specifically identifies an individual (e.g., a Taskworld customer could upload to the Service information about its employees or other users of the Service in order to make use of the Service, including information that specifically identifies individuals such as name and email address), that information is not Personal Information for the purposes of this Policy. Please see the “Customer Data and Security” section below for information regarding Taskworld’s handling of Customer Data.
Collection of Information
Collection of Voluntarily-Provided Information We collect Personal Information that our users provide to us in a variety of ways on our Service. These include the following:
E-mail Newsletters. We may offer e-mail newsletters from time to time on our Service. If you sign up to receive a newsletter from us, we collect your e-mail address.
User Accounts and Profiles. Our Service may give you the ability to register for a Taskworld account or to create and update a user profile on the applicable Service. If we offer user account or profile functionality on the Service, we will collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of registering for an account or creating or updating a user profile. This information may include, for example, name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, and related demographic information about you. We may indicate that some Personal Information is required for you to register for the account or to create the profile, while some is optional.
Interactive Features. Our Service may contain interactive functionality that allows you to engage with other users on the Service, post comments to forums, to upload photographs and other content (the “ User Materials “), participate in surveys, and otherwise to interact with the Service and with other users. If you use any interactive functionality on our Service that request or permit you to provide us with Personal Information (including, for example, any services that allow you to post User Materials on any of our Service), we collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of using these interactive features.
Correspondence. If you contact us by e-mail, using a contact form on the Service, or by mail, fax, or other means, we collect the Personal Information contained within, and associated with, your correspondence.
Contests and Sweepstakes. We or our advertisers and other business partners may conduct or sponsor special contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions that users may enter or otherwise participate in on our Service. Certain of these promotions may be co-branded with one of our advertisers or other business partners. In these instances, the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the third-party partner on its website or other online service and may be shared with us. The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such Personal Information.
Passive Information Collection When you visit our Service, some information is collected automatically. For example, when you access our Service, we may automatically collect your browser’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type, the nature of the device from which you are visiting the Service (e.g., a personal computer or a mobile device), the identifier for any handheld or mobile device that you may be using, the Web site that you visited immediately prior to accessing any Web-based Service, the actions you take on our Service, and the content, features, and activities that you access and participate in on our Service. We also may collect information regarding your interaction with e-mail messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message.
We may collect this information passively using technologies such as standard server logs, cookies, and clear GIFs (also known as “Web beacons”). We use passively-collected information to administer, operate, and improve the Website and our other services and systems, to improve the effectiveness of advertising on our Service, and to provide advertisements and other content that is tailored to you.
If we link or associate any information gathered through passive means with Personal Information, or if applicable laws require us to treat any information gathered through passive means as Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Policy. Otherwise, we use and disclose information collected by passive means in aggregate form or otherwise in a non-personally identifiable form.
Please be aware that in the course of your use of the Service, websites or other services provided by third parties (“ Third-Party Services “), including, for example, Google Analytics, may set cookies on your hard drive or use other means of passively collecting information about your use of the Service, Third-Party Services or other services or content. To do this, they may use first-party cookies (which are set by the same domain your browser is receiving data from) or third-party cookies (which are set by a different domain). Taskworld also may make non-personal information available to Third-Party Services, and these Third-Party Services may collect such information, to assist such parties in understanding our users’ activities and usage patterns on the Services.
We do not have access to, or control over, the actions of Third-Party Services. Each provider of Third-Party Services uses information that it collects in accordance with its own privacy and security policies.
With respect to Google, please be aware that we may use Google Analytics. Google, in the course of providing services or placing advertisements, may place or recognize one or more unique cookies on your computer, and may record information to these cookies based upon your activities on our Services and on third-party websites and other Third-Party Services. Google may use information about those activities to inform, optimize, and serve advertisements. Google may, for example, customize and serve advertisements on a Third-Party Service based on content you viewed on our Services. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
Information from Other Sources We may receive information about you, including Personal Information such as gender and previous place of work from third parties, such as to integrate your social media profile onto the Taskworld platform. We may combine this information with other Personal Information we maintain about you. If we do so, this Policy governs any combined information that we maintain in personally identifiable format.
