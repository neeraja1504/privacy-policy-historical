We keep your data for only as long as we need to. How long we need your personal data depends on what we are using it for. For example, we may need it to use it to answer your queries about our services or where required by law. If you decide to take a break from Tastebuds and deactivate your profile, we will not show your profile on the Tastebuds services and you will not appear in anyone's search results or emails of suggested matches.

If we have asked for your permission to process your personal data and we have no other lawful grounds to continue with that processing, and you withdraw your permission, we will delete your personal data. However, when you unsubscribe from marketing communications, we will keep your email address to ensure that we do not send you any marketing communications in future.
