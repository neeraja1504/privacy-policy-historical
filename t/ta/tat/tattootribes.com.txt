TattooTribes.com Privacy Policy
Last Revised: August 21, 2009
This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by TattooTribes.com("TT", "we" or "us") with respect to your use of the web site located at www.tattootribes.com or other sites as may be owned, managed or controlled by us from time to time (the "Site") so you can make an informed decision about using the Site. We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the privacy policy the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.
WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?
As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or other), and information about that individual's location or activities, such as information about his or her use of the Site, when directly linked to personally identifiable information. A user name may be personal information if it includes personally identifying information such as a first and last name. Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site, services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Site. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.
WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
Active Collection.
Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit our Site. We may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information. For example, we may collect your name and email address when you register to our feeds or contact us by e-mail or other means for any reason such as entering our free tattoo lottery (we need to send you an email to inform you about lottery results, and asking for more informations on your request in case you win).
Passive Collection.
When you use the Site, some information is also automatically collected, including but not limited to your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and your activity on the Site. We treat this information as aggregate information only.
We may automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies". Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user's hard drive at the request of a Web site to enable the site to help users have a smoother experience, by keeping their language of choice and similar behaviours. Informations provided may be used, among other things, to better understand the usage and visitation of our Site. For third party ads policies on our site we suggest you to check Google's Adsense privacy policy. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site and the Service may not function properly. For example, you may not be able to keep your desired language.
HOW DO WE USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT?
In general, we use personal information we collect to process your requests, to provide you with information or services you request, to inform you about other information, events, promotions, products or services we think will be of interest to you, to facilitate your use of, and our administration and operation of, the Site, and for the purpose for which the information was provided.
