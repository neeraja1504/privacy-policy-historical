Why We Collect Information
In this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means any information that can be used to identify you.  This includes, without limitation, your name, address, telephone number, email address, IP address, date of birth, gender, nationality, occupation, personal identification or passport details, golf scores, handicap and other golf-related information, golf club membership, golf product preferences, golf club fitting specifications, photographs, video, preferred communication methods, payment information, and any other types of information that you choose to provide to us or that we may collect about you through other public sources, such as national and regional golf associations.
TaylorMade collects personal information because it is necessary to enable us to deliver products and services.  For example, if you order a product, we need to have information such as your billing address, product choice, delivery information, and payment processing information.  Your personal information also helps us communicate with you about our latest products, special offers, sweepstakes, and other information and events you might like to know about, if you so choose.
We also collect your personal information to help us design, deliver operation of, and tailor your experience on the TaylorMade Websites.  We may also correlate the personal information you have provided with information from other sources, which may help us to develop a more targeted user profile concerning you and/or your demographic information.  For example, if you provide us with your personal information, we may cross-check that against information that might otherwise be available through entities with whom we have a business relationship in order to develop a more in-depth demographic profile of you.  We may also process personal information to target specific items of interest to you.
When you sign-up to receive marketing communications from us, we ask for your name and e-mail address.
What Information We Collect
Whenever you register a TaylorMade product, send us an email, purchase a product from a TaylorMade Website, register on one of the TaylorMade Websites, enter a contest, sweepstakes, or other promotion, submit data through one of our applications, call our customer service department, subscribe to one of our newsletters, interact with us via a social networking service, or otherwise transmit information via any of the TaylorMade Websites, TaylorMade may obtain and collect your personal information, such as the following, without limitation:
Your first and last name;
Your contact details, including your postal address, telephone number, and email address;
Your physical traits, including handedness and handicap; and
Your game performance data, including your golf scores, and club preferences.
Information We Collect Automatically
We do not automatically collect your home address, email address, telephone number, and product preferences unless you voluntarily input this information, such as when creating an account, placing an order, or inputting golf round data into an application like myroundpro.com, or when you submit questions or comments, request information, or participate in online surveys, contests, promotions or other activities.  However, as is true of most websites, the TaylorMade Websites collect certain information automatically and store it in log files by using cookies and other automated technologies.  For more information on our use of cookies, please see below in the “Cookies” section of this Privacy Policy and in our Cookies Policy found here.
In addition to any personal information or other information that you choose to submit to the TaylorMade Websites, we and our third-party service providers (including content and analytics providers and advertising companies) may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the TaylorMade Websites or one of our advertisements or other content elsewhere online (“Usage Information”).  Usage Information may include the browser you are using, the URL that referred you to the TaylorMade Websites, all of the areas within the TaylorMade Websites that you visit, and the time of the visit, among other information.  Our systems may also automatically gather information about the search terms you use on the TaylorMade Websites and the links you select from within the TaylorMade Websites to other areas of the Web or elsewhere online.  In addition, we may collect your IP address or other unique identifier of your computer, cell phone, or other device used to access the TaylorMade Websites (collectively referred to as a “Device Identifier”).  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, your cell phone, or other device used to access the TaylorMade Websites, and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier.  Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you and therefore identifiable.  Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with you, as an individual and identifiable person, we will treat it as personal information.
Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit.  There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context.  Like many websites and online services, the TaylorMade Websites currently do not alter their practices when they receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
Chat Rooms and Forums
The TaylorMade Websites may now or in the future include chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution before disclosing your personal information via these public venues, which you do at your own risk. If you do so, you may receive unsolicited emails or "spam" from others. TaylorMade cannot safeguard the privacy of personal information that is disclosed online in this manner.
Computer Profiles
TaylorMade may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data that helps us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For example, we may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. If you do not register on one of the TaylorMade Websites, none of this information is personally identifiable.
How We Collect Information
We collect information in three primary ways:
You give us information:  We collect information from you when you create an account with us, sign up to receive marketing communications, purchase a product from us, or when you interact with us about a product, service, or promotion we offer.
We collect information automatically:  We automatically collect certain types of personal information when you visit the TaylorMade Websites.  For example we automatically collect various types of technical information when you use the TaylorMade Websites as described in this Privacy Policy.
We collect information from other sources:  We may obtain information about you from outside sources.  For example, we may obtain commercially available information about you from third parties, such as demographic information for advertising and marketing purposes, or, if you own and use our interactive “smart” putter, we may collect your putting data from Blast Motion, Inc. whose sensor is featured in the putter.  We may also receive information from third parties who provide third-party tracking services through web-beacons as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy.
Children's Online Privacy Protection
TaylorMade does not knowingly collect contact or personal information from children under 13.  The TaylorMade Websites are not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13.  If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.  If you want to notify us of our receipt of information by children under 13, please do so by emailing us at privacy@taylormadegolf.com.
California users under the age of 18 may request the removal of their content or information publicly posted on the TaylorMade Websites by e-mailing us at privacy@taylormadegolf.com.  Please note that most of the user content that appears on the TaylorMade Websites is stored and controlled by third party providers; thus, complete and comprehensive removal of the content may not be possible.
Use of Cookies
Our browser software includes a feature called "cookies." If enabled, cookies may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the TaylorMade Websites. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you visit most often and what content you may have viewed during past visits. When you re-visit the TaylorMade Websites, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use cookies to:
keep count of return visits to the TaylorMade Websites
accumulate and report anonymous, aggregate, statistical information on website usage
deliver content and advertising specific to your interests or past viewing history
You can also disable cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you can accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set.
Use of Web Beacons
The TaylorMade Websites and certain emails sent to opt-in consumers contain electronic images (called "pixels", "transparent GIF files", or "web beacons") that allow us and our advertising partners to view and access cookies. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon.  A web beacon is a transparent graphic image placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed or that an email has been forwarded.  In some cases these files are provided by our online management partner. These files enable our online management partner to recognize a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to the TaylorMade Websites. The cookie was placed by us or by another advertiser that works with our online management partner. We may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters and other emails containing graphics that we send, so we may count the number of newsletters and emails that have been opened and read.
Advertising and Online Tracking
We may also use the web beacon and cookies to monitor your online behavior and interests on the TaylorMade Websites and communications from TaylorMade to tailor advertisements and other communications shown and sent to you to market our goods and services. With both cookies and web beacons, the information stored by the web beacon or cookie does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. Our systems do not recognize browser “Do Not Track” signals, but several of our service providers who utilize these cookies and other tracking technologies on the TaylorMade Websites enable you to opt out from receiving this type of advertising. For more information about third party cookies and web beacons, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, click here.
If you would like to know more about how TaylorMade uses cookies and web beacons, including how to opt out of these technologies, please read our Cookies Policy found here.  We also provide you with additional tools to opt out of receiving marketing communications from us or certain transfers of your information. Please see the “Personal Information Maintenance & Opt-Out” section of this Privacy Policy for more information.
Use of IP Addresses
TaylorMade does not store or record the Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses of visitors to the TaylorMade Websites for marketing purposes, although we may store IP addresses in server logs for features such as to keep your shopping cart active, for system maintenance purposes, or to store the source location whenever someone provides Personal Information. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. An Internet Service Providers ("ISP") typically assigns a random IP addresses at the time of your dial-up. For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. We cannot determine your identity solely based upon your IP address. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages, but these IP addresses are never associated with Internet users.
How We Use the Information We Collect
TaylorMade may use your personal information in the following ways:

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights).  This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.  We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.  Occasionally, it may take us longer than 30 days to deal with your request if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.  In this case. We will notify you and keep you updated.

You have the right to request us to stop processing your personal information for marketing purposes, commonly known as opt-out requests.  If you wish to opt-out of our use and/or disclosure of your personal information, other than to process any purchase orders and communicate with you about your account, you will have the option to do so when you first submit your personal information via the TaylorMade Websites.  You are opting into receiving marketing communications from TaylorMade if you check the box stating that you want to receive emails or marketing communications from TaylorMade Golf, and you are opting out if you leave the box unchecked.  At any time thereafter, If you wish to opt out or amend or delete any personal information you have previously provided without opting out, please send us a message at privacy@taylormadegolf.com.  We will endeavor to provide a simple way to review, correct, update or remove personal information you have given us.  If you wish to stop receiving a TaylorMade newsletter that you have previously subscribed for or any other marketing communications, please follow the "unsubscribe" instructions contained at the bottom of each newsletter or email.
Retention of Your Personal Information
Your personal information may be retained by TaylorMade for as long as the purposes for which the personal information was collected continue and require so, or if the retention is necessary for our legal or business purposes.  For example, we may need to retain your personal information if we need to defend a legal claim or in case of a dispute.  In addition, we retain the right to keep non-identifiable information related to your game performance, use of TaylorMade products and/or applications for research and development purposes to improve our products and your user experience.  We will keep your personal information shared by you for direct marketing purposes until you notify us (by opting out) that you no longer wish to receive marketing materials from us.

Security
The TaylorMade Websites use physical, electronic and managerial security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control.
We use Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") connections with 128-bit encryption for certain transactions and confidential data. When you use a secure browser, all information you submit comes to us over the Internet in an encrypted form. Every secure page uses a digital certificate issued by a third-party certification authority. A "site certificate" sits on all secure pages.

We monitor system and application activity logs to identify any unusual activity from authorized and/or unauthorized individuals accessing our systems and/or making changes to stored information.

We recommend you do not divulge your password to anyone. TaylorMade will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited telephone call or email.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit, and you do so at your own risk. You can report network abuse and any risk of security violations to us by emailing privacy@taylormadegolf.com.
