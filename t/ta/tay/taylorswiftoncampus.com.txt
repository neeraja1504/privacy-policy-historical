WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU DO WE COLLECT AND HOW DO WE USE IT?
By accessing the Sites or using the Services, you may provide to us two types of information: (1) personally-identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to disclose to us, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card, debit card or other payment information; and (2) non-personally-identifiable information, which we collect through the use of cookies and tracking technologies.
You may be asked to submit personally-identifiable information to access or use certain aspects of the Services offered on the Sites. For example, when you create an account, subscribe to our mailing list, make a purchase, contact us, receive customer or technical support, or participate in chat rooms, forums or surveys, or in contests, sweepstakes or other promotions, you maybe be asked to submit personally-identifiable information. The personally-identifiable information that you provide to us allows us, among other things, to fulfill your service request or product order, respond to your questions, contact you about your account or your order, alert you of new products or services and new product and service features, inform you of being selected as a winner (when applicable), and/or inform you about new promotions, special events, and other offers that we think may be of interest to you.
We use cookies for a variety of purposes. We may use cookies for system administration, to assess the performance of the Sites and the Services, to enhance your online experience, and to personalize your use of the Sites. You may choose to disable cookies on your computer, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored on your computer (please consult instructions for your web browser). However, if you disable or block certain cookies, it is possible that some parts of the Sites or the Services will not be available to you.
We use tracking technologies, including web logs and web beacons (also called “clear GIFs,” “1x1 GIFs,” “pixel tags” or “pixels”), to allow our servers to automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit the Sites. This information includes the time and date, your Internet Protocol address, your geographic location (your zip code, your area code and/or your time zone), your browser type and version, the Sites and/or the Services that you use and when and how long you use them, and technical information that identifies your mobile device. We use this information to monitor and analyze how our users use the Sites and the Services, to provide customer service, and to maintain and improve the Services. We may also use this information to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests, on the Sites and on third-party websites.
WILL WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH OTHER PARTIES?
We may use your personally-identifiable information and your non-personally-identifiable information to provide analyses of the users of the Sites and the Services, in the aggregate, to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties. We may also share your non-personally-identifiable information with our business partners for the purpose of their delivering content, including ads, on the Sites and on third-party websites.
We may disclose your personally-identifiable information to our employees, agents, contractors and sub-contractors, and to our related and affiliated entities, including, but not limited to, 13 Management, LLC, Firefly Entertainment, Inc., Swift Merchandising, Inc., Taylor Swift Productions, Inc., and their respective employees, agents, contractors and sub-contractors, for the limited purpose of enabling them to communicate with you directly about events and promotions that may be of interest to you. We will share your personally-identifiable information with other parties under the following circumstances:
We will not share your personally-identifiable information with third parties for the purposes of their direct marketing unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure.
WHAT CHOICES DO YOU HAVE ABOUT THE COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION?
For any of the Services that include an account access, you may review, update or delete your personally-identifiable information, and/or modify your account preferences for the Services, by accessing the “My Account” area of the Services or by contacting us at privacy@taylorswift.com. To update or delete personally-identifiable information that you had provided in connection with any other Services, you may contact us at privacy@taylorswift.com. Please note that when you delete your account or request that we delete your personally-identifiable information, we may retain your information for a reasonable period of time for the purpose of internal account management and fraud prevention.
If you no longer wish to receive our announcements by e-mail, you may unsubscribe from receiving them at any time by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of our e-mails and following subsequent instructions, or by writing to us at privacy@taylorswift.com. If you e-mail us to change your contact preferences, we will implement your requested changes within a reasonable period of time. Please note that your requested changes will not be effective until we implement such changes. Please also note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain correspondence from us, such as messages relating to your account transactions.
If you choose to join one of our mobile marketing lists, please be aware that there are usually costs associated with receiving SMS or MMS messages, which are determined by your carrier. You should contact your carrier to determine the charges that may apply before you sign up to receive our updates via SMS or MMS. If you wish to stop receiving such messages from us, at any time, simply write “STOP” in a reply to any message from us.
You agree that, in the event that any dispute or claim arises out of or relating to this Policy or our privacy practices, you will attempt in good faith to negotiate a written resolution of the matter directly with Taylor Nation, LLC and/or our affiliates and/or related entities, depending on your concern. You agree that if the matter remains unresolved for forty-five (45) days after notification (via Certified Mail or personal delivery) that a dispute exists, the parties shall join in mediation services in Nashville, Davidson County, Tennessee, with a mutually chosen mediator, in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Should you file any arbitration claims, any administrative actions, and/or any court actions without first having attempted to resolve your claim by mediation, then you agree that you will not be entitled to recover any costs of the proceeding, including, without limitation, your attorneys’ fees or other costs, even if you would otherwise be entitled to them.
WHAT IS OUR POLICY ON TRACKING?
You may be able to adjust your browser’s settings to turn on a “do not track” feature. Although our policy may change in the future, because there is no uniform standard for “do not track” signal recognition currently, we do not support “do not track” and will not honor your web browser’s “do not track” signal.
We do not intentionally or knowingly allow other parties to collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites, when you visit the Sites or use any of the Services.
WHAT SECURITY MEASURES DO WE TAKE?
The personally-identifiable information that you provide to us is stored on servers that are located in secured facilities with restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure reasonable security of such information. In addition, we restrict access to your personally-identifiable information to those of our employees, independent contractors and agents who need to know this information in order to develop, operate and maintain the Sites and the Services. However, no data transmission over the Internet or through mobile telecommunications can be guaranteed to be completely secure, and, for this reason, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us or that is transmitted to us as a result of your use of the Sites and/or the Services. You can help protect your personally-identifiable information by using strong passwords, changing your password often, using a secure web browser, and signing off and closing your web browser when you are finished with the use of the Sites.
DOES THIS POLICY APPLY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES?
We comply with the United States privacy laws and regulations. We do not represent that the Sites are governed by, or operated in accordance with, the laws of other nations, or that the Sites or any portion of the Sites are appropriate or available for use in any particular location. If you choose to access the Sites, you do so at your own risk, and you are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations. By using any part of the Sites, visitors to the Sites from outside the United States acknowledge and agree that the Sites are subject to United States laws and regulations, and waive any claims against us that may arise under their own national laws.
