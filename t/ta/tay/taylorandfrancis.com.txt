What information do we collect?
When you submit a request form on this Website we ask for your full name, company name, job title and e-mail address ("Personal Data").
Use of Personal Data
Your privacy is very important to us, that's why we'll take great care of any personal information you share with us and will never release these details to any company outside the Informa group of companies for any other purpose other than which it was collected without your consent (either under this privacy policy or otherwise) unless required by law or otherwise needed to fulfil orders, legal proceedings etc.
The Personal Data we collect on this Website is used to provide you with the service or subscription that you have requested, the role you have applied for, or to respond to an enquiry that you have made.  We use certain third party service providers to assist us in providing these services to you, for example, recruitment, email marketing and hosting.

Period of grace
Should you request that we amend or suppress records containing your Personal Data we will endeavour to do so as promptly as practical; however you may receive communications for a transitional period whilst we process your records.
Cookies
When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful, and reliable. Where services are delivered on the Internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.
These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through (for example):
enabling a service to recognize your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task
recognizing that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested
measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast.
If you do not accept cookies you will be unable to use this website. You can, however, manage these small files yourself and learn more about them through Internet browser cookies - what they are and how to manage them.
