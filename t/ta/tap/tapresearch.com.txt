TapResearch: Privacy Policy
This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes the information collected by TapResearch, Inc. (“we,” “us,” or “our,” including our affiliates and subsidiaries), how we collect that information, how that information may be used, and with whom it may be shared. By accessing or using our website, http://www.tapresearch.com (the “Website”), participating in our surveys, or using other products or services we provide (collectively, “Services”), you are accepting the practices set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, then you must not access or use the Services. Our Services may be offered through or in connection with third party mobile applications or third party websites. When you participate in the Services you are leaving the third party mobile application or website through which you accessed the Services.
Information Collected and Method of Collection
Information collected is relevant for the purpose for which it is to be used and, to the extent necessary, TapResearch takes reasonable steps to ensure that data is reliable for intended use, accurate, complete, and current.
Information collected automatically: When you use the Services, we automatically collect and store information about your computer or mobile device and your online activities (“Response Metadata”), which we transfer and store in accordance with the provisions contained in this Privacy Policy. Response Metadata may include:
Device Information/Specifications. Technical information about your computer or device (e.g., type of device, web browser or operating system, IP address, etc.).
Geographic Location. We use your IP address to derive your computer or device's approximate geographic location.
Time, Length and Extent of Usage. When you use the Services, how long you use a Service for (e.g., how long it takes you to answer a survey question) and which Services feature(s) and/or function(s) you use.
Cookies: We may use cookies to keep track of some types of information while you are using the Services. Cookies are very small files placed on your computer, which allow us to perform analytics, such as counting the number of users of the Services and distinguishing repeat users from new or unique users. Cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze usage of the Services more accurately, such as user preferences or trends (e.g., the Services may set a cookie on your browser allowing you to bypass engagement with a survey due to your previous completion of a survey). We rely on cookies for the proper operation of the Services; therefore if your browser is set to reject cookies, the Services may not function properly. If you refuse cookies from the Services, you assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality or benefits with respect to the Services.
Mobile Device ID: We collect mobile device identifiers, such as Apple’s Identifier for Advertising ID (IDFA) or Google’s Android Advertising ID (AAID), to help us identify you within a mobile application and match you with appropriate survey opportunities.
Web Beacons: We may use web beacons in email communications in order to understand the behavior of our users. “Web beacons” (also known as “clear gifs” and “pixel tags”) are small transparent graphic images that are often used in conjunction with cookies in order to further personalize the Services for our users and to collect a limited set of information about our users.
Information you provide to us: We collect information that you submit to us voluntarily through the Services.
**User Profile Information **
Before you fill out a survey, we ask that you create a user profile to help us match you with a survey. When you fill out a user profile, we collect certain information, including demographic information such as postal code, gender, marital status, education, ethnicity/race (where permitted by applicable law), employment related information, and non-personally identifiable information on household members, household income, age, etc.
**Registration Information **
If you choose to sign up for an account, we also collect additional information from you, including:

Email address
Username and password
**Survey Information **
Occasionally, we host surveys for our survey partners and collect the information submitted through these surveys. We do not own this information and any information you choose to provide is used in accordance with the survey partner’s privacy practices.
**User Feedback **
If you provide us with comments, suggestions, recommendations or other feedback pertaining to our Services (collectively “Feedback’), you understand that we may (although we have no obligation to do so) retain, disclose, use, or otherwise commercially exploit that Feedback in connection with any or all of our Services without any compensation or consideration to you.
**Developer Information **
We may collect certain information from our developer partners at the time of registration and in connection with your use of the Services, including your name, email address, company name, app title(s), as well as financial information such as Tax ID, VAT or sales tax registration number or any other relevant tax number and payment information (e.g., bank account and routing number for ACH purposes).

Third Party Links, Websites, and Services

We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third party sites, applications, services, and surveys nor any data or information you may share with such third parties.
