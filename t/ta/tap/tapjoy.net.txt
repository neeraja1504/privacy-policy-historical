Tapjoy values the privacy of the users, subscribers, members, and others who visit and use the Tapjoy Platform (collectively or individually, "you" or "Users").
By using the Tapjoy Platform, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy, please do not use the Tapjoy Platform.
This Privacy Policy should be read in connection with, and is incorporated by reference into, the terms of use that govern the particular Tapjoy service you are using. Your use of the Tapjoy Platform and any personal information you provide to Tapjoy through the Tapjoy Platform are subject at all time to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.
1. The Information Tapjoy Collects
User-provided Information: You may provide to Tapjoy what is generally called "personally identifiable" information (such as your name, email address, gender, age, postal mailing address, telephone number and billing information) if you upload or download certain content or products to or from the Tapjoy Platform, enter contests or sweepstakes, take advantage of promotions, respond to surveys, register and subscribe for certain services, or otherwise use the features and functionality of the Tapjoy Platform.

"Cookies" Information: When you access the Tapjoy Platform, we may send one or more cookies - small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer. Tapjoy may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Tapjoy Platform. Both session cookies and persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Some of our business partners (e.g. advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Tapjoy only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
"Automatically Collected" Information: When you access the Tapjoy Platform or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology. This "automatically collected" information may include Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), a unique user ID, version of software installed, system type, screen resolutions, color capabilities, plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords, JavaScript enablement, the content and pages that you access on the Tapjoy Platform, and the dates and times that you visit the Tapjoy Platform, paths taken, and time spent on sites and pages.
2. Web Beacons
Our web pages may contain electronic image requests (called a "single-pixel gif" or "web beacon" request) that allow us to count page views and to access cookies. Any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. Web beacons are typically 1-by-1 pixel files, but their presence can usually be seen within a browser by clicking on "View" and then on "Source." We may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters that we send to opt-in subscribers in order to count how many newsletters have been read. Tapjoy web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor or share any personally identifiable information about our web site visitors, they are just the technique we use to compile anonymous information about web site usage.
