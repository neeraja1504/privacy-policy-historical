Privacy Policy
Mandatory Disclosure
Tagroom facilitates an open relationship between our Users and Advertisers. The Advertisers that offer our free offers are required to disclose their relationship with marketers in their communications with other consumers. We are an affiliate and advertising based website. Our advertisers provide revenue for our site. We may or may not make a commission from a free offer on Tagroom.
We comply with FTC regulations that state, “When there exists a connection between the endorser and the seller of the advertised product which might materially affect the weight or credibility of the endorsement (i.e., the connection is not reasonably expected by the audience) such connection must be fully disclosed.” Tagroom is committed to respecting the privacy rights of users of the Website (all capitalised terms not defined in this notice have the same meanings as in Tagroom’s Website Terms of Use, which is incorporated herein by reference). Tagroom created this Privacy Policy to give You confidence as You visit and use the Website, and to demonstrate its commitment to fair information practices and to the protection of privacy.
This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Website and not to any Third-Party Websites, which may have data collection, storage and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. For additional information, see the section concerning Third-Party Websites, below.
BY USING THE WEBSITE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO THE TERMS OF, THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY LEAVE THE WEBSITE.
Each time You use the Website, the then-current version of this Privacy Policy will apply.

Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify You.
(b) Cookies. A “Cookie” is a string of information that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website. The purpose of a Cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the Website. Tagroom uses Cookies to customise Your experience on the Website to Your interests, to ensure that You do not see the same advertisements or informational messages repeatedly, and to store Your password so You do not have to re-enter it each time You visit the Website.
