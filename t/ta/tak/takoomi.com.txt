COLLECTION AND USE OF END USER ANALYTICS INFORMATION.
The Platform provides information to you about how your End Users use online browsing and their mobile applications as well as how applications are performing across different mobile devices (but the Platform does not collect personally identifiable information about your End Users). Takoomi obtains this information either directly from our Customers (typically with the use of advertising links) or from our Software Development Kit (“SDK”) if embedded by you in an End User's mobile application.
The data collected may include: agent version, platform, SDK version, timestamp, API key (identifier for application), application version, device identifier—e.g., MAC address, Android ID, and IFA—Model, manufacture and OS version of device, session start/stop time, locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), time zone, and network status (WiFi, etc.). The device identifiers may be hashed. In addition, Takoomi may collect the following data if you select the option for Takoomi to collect and provide such data to Takoomi: anonymous User ID, latitude and longitude, events, errors, and page views. Finally, we see the IP address of the user through the HTTP request.

We may provide you with the option of exporting raw Takoomi data to your servers such as timestamp, platform, event, and user ID. You can also record errors that occur in your applications and receive an export of data containing the error information.
Your End User data is presented to you to analyze your applications. In addition, Takoomi may provide you with aggregated and anonymous benchmark data that includes your End User data and all other Customers' End User data.  But while Takoomi assists you with the organization and collection of End User data, Takoomi specifically disclaims ownership of this data. The End User data stored by our servers belongs exclusively to our Customers and may be deleted any time at their request.
