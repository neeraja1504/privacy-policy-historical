Cookies
Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies help make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.
Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain in your device's memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to recognize your browser when you next visit the site.
You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.
Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions you wish to use (such as the TSViewer) are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy policy and our cookie policy.
Server log files
The website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically transmits to us in "server log files". These are:
Browser type and browser version
Operating system used
Referrer URL
Host name of the accessing computer
Time of the server request
IP address
These data will not be combined with data from other sources.
The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in detecting and preventing fraud and unauthorized system access, and ensuring the security of the system.
Registration of TeamSpeak 3 servers on this website
You can register your TeamSpeak 3 servers on our website in order to allow additional functions offered here. We only use the input data entered for the purpose of offering this service.
TSViewer.com is a server list for TeamSpeak 3 servers. All visible information is queried and evaluated via the TCP Query interface of the TeamSpeak 3 server. Of course, we can only evaluate the data that any visitor on the TeamSpeak 3 server can also see. The owner of the TeamSpeak 3 server decides for himself whether he makes this information available to the public. If we have the opportunity, it is also possible for third parties to query this data directly from the TeamSpeak 3 server. In the standard installation of a TeamSpeak 3 server, the necessary rights are not granted.
IP addresses or other personal data (address, phone number, bank details, etc.) of the users are not transmitted to us.
The registrant / owner of the TeamSpeak 3 server can remove the registration and all associated information from the server list at any time. Upon deletion, all data will be permanently removed.
To inform you about important changes such as those within the scope of our site or technical changes, we will use the email address specified during registration.
We will process the data provided during registration only based on your consent per Art. 6 (1)(a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient, alternatively you can delete the server yourself, as mentioned before. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.
We will continue to store the data collected during registration for as long as the server remains registered on our website. Statutory retention periods remain unaffected.
Leaving comments on this website
If you use the comment function on this site, the time at which you created the comment will be stored along with your comment, as well as your username, unless you are posting anonymously.
Storage of the IP address
Our comment function stores the IP addresses of those users who post comments. Since we do not check comments on our site before they go live, we need this information to be able to pursue action for illegal or slanderous content.
How long comments are stored
The comments and the associated data (e.g. IP address) are stored and remain on our website until the content commented upon has been completely deleted or the comments are required to be removed for legal reasons (slander, etc.).
Legal basis
The comments are stored based on your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.
