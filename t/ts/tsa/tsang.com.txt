What are cookies? How does tsang.com use cookies on its site?
A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer’s hard drive when you visit their sites. A cookie may contain information, such as a unique user ID that websites use to track the pages of the sites you’ve visited. We use cookies but do not store personally identifiable information in your cookie.
We use cookies in order to improve your shopping experience. Cookies enable us to keep track of your order as you shop on our site.
Through our use of cookies, we also track and maintain the identity of the web site you visited immediately prior to visiting our website. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites.
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you turn off cookies, though, we will not be able to track your order to enable you to purchase from our site. Nor will we be able to recognize you as a registered user, which allows you to access your account information.
How do I know my order information is secure?
We process payments through PayPal who uses Verisign’s industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from “http” to “https.”
Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don’t permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at tsang.com. In that case, you’ll be unable to connect to the server, which means you won’t be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please your order by email customerservice@tsang.com
