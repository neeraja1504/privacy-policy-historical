That legislation requires any business that discloses a customer?s personal information (as defined by the act) to any third party for direct marketing purposes to provide the customer a method for obtaining the names, addresses and certain other specified details of anyone who might have received that personal information. If you are a California resident you may request this information from Tiburon Media by writing to Tiburon Media, 39 Main Street, Tiburon, CA 94920 .
