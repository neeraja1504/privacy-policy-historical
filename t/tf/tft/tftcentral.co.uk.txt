Log Files
As is common practice across the internet, TFTCentral makes use of log files from Google Analytics. The information inside the log files includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, Internet Service Provider (ISP), browser type, date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and number of clicks to analyse trends, administer the site, track user’s movement around the site, and gather demographic information. IP addresses and other such information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. If you would not like your usage to be tracked in this way it is possible to  opt out of Google Analytics and prevent tracking cookies being placed on your computer.
Other Cookies
In addition to Google Analytics tracking cookies TFTCentral will place temporary session identification cookies on your computer if you log into the website to post on the forum / message board. These are non-tracking cookies which we have no access to – they do not send any information to us or any third party. They are used purely to allow you to access the forums without re-entering details each time to log on.
If you wish to disable cookies you may do so through your individual browser options. This action will apply universally and not just to those collected from your visit to our website. More detailed information about cookie management specific to various web browsers can be found on aboutcookies.org.
