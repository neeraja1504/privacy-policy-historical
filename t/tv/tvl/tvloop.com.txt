The Information We Collect
1) Watercooler Applications on Partner-Operated Websites
In order to use Watercooler applications on partner-operated websites (e.g., Facebook, Friendster, etc.), you must 1) be a registered member of a partner site, and 2) install a Watercooler application in your partner site account. By installing our applications on your partner site account, you agree to the partner site's terms of service, which allow application developers like Watercooler to store certain information about you. The application developer terms of service vary from partner to partner in this regard.
When you install a Watercooler application in your partner site account, we assign you a unique identifying number and allow you to choose a default display name, which we retain. Your display name serves as your publicly visible identity within all websites and applications that serve Watercooler's products. This includes but is not limited to Facebook, Myspace, Hi5, Friendster, Bebo, and Watercooler's TVLoop.com and FanSection.com websites. Your display name is editable at any time by going to your profile page within your Watercooler application.
Watercooler abides by the terms of service of all partner sites. If you have any questions about your privacy, please contact privacy@watercooler-inc.com.Â  Watercooler takes your privacy very seriously and will respond to all inquiries promptly.

You have the option to provide demographic and professional information (such as education, interests, and resume) to us; we encourage you to submit this information so other users can interact with your profile.
If you choose to send an invitation to a friend to join a Watercooler website, or if you choose to forward a video, quote, quiz, or other Watercooler asset to a friend, you may choose to enter your friends' email addresses manually or import them from your email provider using a tool provided by Watercooler.

Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.

Web Site Usage
Like most web sites, Watercooler uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows Watercooler to recognize you as a user when you return to our site using the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our applications. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site.
Log Files
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site to improve our service, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We do link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are only tied to personally identifiable information in the event we try to identify possible fraudulent activities.
We use a third-party tracking service, Google Analytics, that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. We use this service to capture usage and volume statistics to help us improve the Watercooler service.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies in our applications. We do link the information we store in cookies to personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.
We use session cookies to confirm that users are logged in. As a convenience feature, we offer an option that will remember your login information for a period of two weeks.

Cookie Opt-Out
We allow each user to opt out of our ad-serving cookies, so that no unique information or number is associated with the end user.s computer browser. Blocking and/or opting out of cookies do not stop advertisements from being served to your computer; rather, it prevents data from being associated with the end user.s browser. Please note that if you choose an opt-out cookie, we will be unable to recognize your browser from one visit to the next, and you may therefore receive the same ad multiple times.

All other cookies associated with your browser will remain intact and your opt-out will be effective for the entire life of your browser on your hard drive or until you delete the cookie file from your hard drive. This opt-out process will erase the cookie ID but not the cookie.
The Way Your Information Is Visible
The primary purpose of entering data into Watercooler is to build your Watercooler profile. Your profile is meant to be shared with fellow fans. As a user, you have control over how much information you choose to share with other fans.
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to personally identify any individual. Certainly these advertisers will never receive your personal contact information.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above. In the event that we do for some unforeseen and unanticipated event in the future, we will give you an opportunity to opt-out of such secondary uses.
Our Commitment To Data Security
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Watercooler employs protected facilities, data encryption on your stored personally identifiable information, firewalls, intrusion detection, and many other security measures to protect your data. We have invested many capital and human resources into our infrastructure to secure the data of our users and will continue to make additional technology investments.
