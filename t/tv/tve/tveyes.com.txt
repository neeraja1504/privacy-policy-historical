TVEyes
We created the following privacy policy guidelines with a fundamental respect for your right to privacy.
What Information is Collected
TVEyes users enter email addresses and keywords of their choice for the purpose of being notified whenever those keywords are spoken on television.
Confidentiality
TVEyes does not provide individually identifiable information to third parties except as noted under “Limits of Confidentiality”. TVEyes uses proprietary technologies to preserve the anonymity of users while matching their interests with targeted information sent via email. TVEyes will under no circumstance reveal any user’s identity to marketers. It is solely at a TVEyes user’s discretion if he or she chooses to provide personally identifiable information to a marketer by making a purchase, requesting additional information, or communicating directly with the company or organization after visiting its web site.
Limits of Confidentiality
Due to the existing legal regulatory and security environment, we may be forced to disclose individually identifiable information to third parties. We will use our best efforts to limit disclosure to only these circumstances where necessary by contract, legal process, or the technical operation of the service.
Use of Information
A TVEyes user’s email address will only be used by TVEyes to periodically contact that user about user-selected interests.
TVEyes uses incoming and outgoing website traffic data to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. We also use it to gather broad demographic information about our users in general. We may combine demographic information supplied by a user at registration time with site usage data to provide profiles, in aggregate form, about our users and their preferences as it relates to the TVEyes Network.
As part of providing customizable and personalized services, TVEyes uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about users. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to a user’s browser from a Web server and stored on a user’s computer hard drive. Areas of TVEyes sites where users are prompted to login or that are customizable require acceptance of cookies.
Review/Modify/Terminate User Account
TVEyes users may choose at any time to review, modify or permanently remove all contact and keyword information stored by TVEyes by accessing their account directly at http://consumer.tveyes.com/log_in.asp. TVEyes will never sell, rent, or otherwise use the contact information of former users.
Third Party Privacy Statement
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. Our third-party advertising company also separately places or recognizes a cookie file on your browser in the course of delivering advertisements to this Site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, TVEyes practices, or feel that your privacy has been compromised, please contact us at info@TVEyes.com.
