TV3 does not collect information that personally identifies individuals except when individuals provide such specific information on a voluntary basis. There may be occasions where specific personal information is requested before an individual can enter certain sections of TV3's site or where registration helps us to ensure that content standards on these sections of the site are rigorously upheld or that contact can be made with prize winners or where a user requests to be sent push notifications. Information requested in order to personalise the Tv3.ie homepage or any other TV3 site section would be a similar example.
In all such cases, TV3 will collect only information that is voluntarily provided by the user and undertakes that such information will be kept strictly confidential. Individual information provided to TV3 to gain access to any TV3 site will not be sold or made available to a third party outside the TV3 group of companies.

"Cookies" are small text files that identify an individual computer's browser entering a web site. They allow the site to track that browser's movement through the site over several sessions. Through cookies, a web site can recognise repeat users, facilitate the user's access to and use of the site and allow a site to track usage behaviour that will allow content improvements. TV3 uses cookies only for the above-mentioned purposes and will not use them to identify users or to track non-TV3 usage.

Ad-Blocking Detection
Our website uses JavaScript to detect the use of ad blocking extensions for web browsers. This script is implemented in the source code of our website. The script simulates the display of an ad and confirms that it is displayed on a user's device. To do this, we do not store any information on users' devices and process no personal data. If we detect that a user deploys an ad blocker, we may interact with them on the use of ad blockers and/or adapt the content available to them. We reserve the right to restrict access to our websites if users do not agree to the use of ad blocker detection mechanisms.
What about cookies on mobile devices and App?
Generally cookies are not used on mobile devices and instead other methods are used to help deliver the best service to users on devices.
