Why we ask you to confirm personal information when you call Bell
Bell places great emphasis on the security of your personal information and has safeguards in place to ensure that it is not disclosed to an unauthorized third party which is why, when calling Bell you'll be asked to confirm certain details regarding your account.
This safeguard will help us prevent pre-texting, often referred to as “social engineering”, which refers to the fraudulent and illegal practice of misrepresenting who you are in order to obtain access to someone else' s information. Bell is aware pre-texting, although illegal, has been a practice employed by unauthorized third parties trying to obtain access to customer information.
The kinds of things we might ask you to confirm could include your account number, PIN or password associated with the account, details of your payment habits, service usage or identification that you might have provided when you first requested your service such as a provincial driver's licence number.
We therefore ask for your patience and understanding when you are asked to confirm or provide such information as this process has been established to protect your personal account information.
Common privacy concerns
Does Bell monitor client Internet usage?
Bell does not usually monitor your use of the service or the content of your emails. However, similar to other Internet service providers, Bell reserves the right to do so from time to time.
For example, in the normal course of business, we may need to review certain aspects such as your bandwidth consumption. This is to ensure that our service is functioning properly, but it may also be to ensure your compliance with the provisions of our Acceptable Use Policy, a copy of which can be found at the end of your service agreement.
Some of the things that will trigger monitoring of your use include:
Spamming
Harassment of other users
Uploading, downloading or otherwise transmitting materials which are protected by copyrights or other intellectual property rights
Assisting or engaging in the fraudulent use of telecommunications services
With your permission, Bell may also use information about your account and network usage for other purposes, such as developing new business and marketing reports and improving the relevance of the ads and marketing partner offers we show you.  We will not share any information that identifies you personally outside of Bell Canada and its affiliates. For more information, see bell.ca/onlinemarketing.

Fraud prevention
Fraud prevention
Every day, scam artists from around the world are finding new ways, and using the latest technology, to break into office networks or personal computers, or invent new phone or online scams in order to steal information and money from unsuspecting consumers.
Because of the variety and sheer volume of these activities, it is virtually impossible to track every incident or find the source of every fake marketing operation. As a result, more and more consumers and businesses are becoming victims of fraud and losing millions every year.
Education is your best protection
We encourage you to find out more about phishing (email fraud), telemarketing scams and other types of activities that can make you vulnerable. Below, are some examples of what you should be looking out for, as well as some tips that will help you stay safe online and offline.
Telemarketing or prize scams
Look out for aggressive marketing tactics, pressure to “act now,” instructions to pay administrative fees for the delivery of a prize or product, etc. Aggressive marketing tactics are often used in order to “close the deal”, enabling the scam artist to quickly obtain your money and important information such as your banking information or credit card number.
Important tip: Watch out for “suspiciously generous” offers and make sure you are dealing with a legitimate business when you make a purchase over the phone or the Internet. Very short offer-expiry dates are often a sign of a scam. Short expiries reduce the risk of the fraudster being traced by authorities.
Some of our customers have had calls from fraudulent telemarketing “operators” claiming to be from Bell. For example, the operators may try to sell new rate plans (which are phony) or they may tell you that they’re updating your account and want you to “confirm” details. Their goal is to trick you into releasing personal information like credit card numbers or social insurance numbers, which can then be used for further fraud. Another example is the use of a pre-recorded message promising customers travel rewards or a $100 credit on their next bill and directing customers to a fake site that “looks” like a legitimate site or a 1-800 number to try to trick customers into disclosing their personal information.
If you get a suspicious call:
Do not give out your personal information. Legitimate companies will never call or email their customers requesting information such as passwords, bank account information or a credit card number, unless they are responding directly to an inquiry you know you have made.
If you suspect that you are speaking with a fraudulent telemarketer, you should end the call and contact the business or organization through its regular channels, for example, 1 866 310-BELL (2355).
Beware of being directed to websites that “look” like the sites from legitimate organizations – it is always best to access the site of a legitimate organization from its direct homepage, e.g. bell.ca.
Email fraud or phishing
This refers to the use of deceptive emails and fake websites using the brand name of a legitimate business or government agency in order to obtain the personal information of web users for purposes of identity theft and other types of fraud. For more information, go to the Bell Internet support site.
Identity theft
Scam artists are now using a wide range of tactics in order to steal your information online and offline. In addition to phishing, your personal information may be pulled from social networking sites, such as Facebook and MySpace, your computer, your mailbox and even your recycling bin.
Important tips:
Be cautious about posting personal information on public websites, such as social networking sites, as those details can be used by fraudsters to convince you that they represent Bell or other companies.
Keep your passwords, bank account information and social insurance number confidential at all times, and check your bank and credit card statements frequently.
Buy a shredder so you can destroy personal documents that you no longer need. You can be targeted for identity theft by fraud artists who find credit-card bills, etc., in your recycling.
Toll fraud
Scam artists use creative schemes to steal your money by accessing your voice mail system, your calling card information or your Web browser and making sure the additional long distance fees are charged to you. Bell’s Fraud Control Centre continuously monitors its networks and works diligently to protect our customers and our employees.
For more useful tips on how to protect yourself from toll fraud, visit our phone fraud page.
Remember, it is your responsibility to remain vigilant and adopt the simple, but important safeguards that can protect you from toll fraud.
Some important tips:
The following are some important tips to help protect you from fraudulent activities:
Be cautious with the information you provide over the phone and make sure no one is watching when keying in your calling card PIN or any other PIN.
Watch out for free downloads over the Web. Some sites will try to draw you in with free offers and then download programs that may be directing your Web browser to telephone an Internet service provider overseas. You could be charged the additional long distance fees.
Always check your monthly statements carefully and look out for unusual charges.
Beware of suspiciously generous offers or prizes from any company.
Look out for aggressive marketing tactics, pressure to “act now,” instructions to pay administrative fees for the delivery of a prize or product, etc.
Very short offer-expiry dates are often a sign of a scam. Short expiries reduce the risk of the fraudster being traced by authorities.
Buy a shredder so you can destroy personal documents that you no longer need. You can be targeted for identity theft by fraud artists who find credit-card bills, etc., in your recycling.
Be cautious about posting personal information on public websites as those details can be used by fraudsters to convince you that they represent Bell or other companies.
Learn about “phishing” and Internet fraud and take steps to protect yourself.
