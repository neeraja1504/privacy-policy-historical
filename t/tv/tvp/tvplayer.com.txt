Accordingly, we will keep a record of your viewing data for up to 26 months following no activity with our website or apps, and we will keep other personal data we hold about you for up to 26 months following the date you close your account with us. This retention period may be extended if any applicable statutory or regulatory obligation requires us to hold information for a longer period. We will endeavor to delete any personal data sooner where it is not necessary for us to hold this.
Please note that if you opt-out of any marketing we will retain a record of your data to ensure that you do not receive any marketing.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you.
