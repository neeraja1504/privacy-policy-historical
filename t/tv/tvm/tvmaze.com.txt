Privacy Policy | TVmaze
TVmaze itself aims to collect as little identifiable information about you as possible. For guest visitors (not logged in) we don't track any personal information at all, for registered users we only store your email and IP address for the purpose of preventing spam. A cookie may be set for no other purpose than to keep you logged in. TVmaze uses Matomo (Piwik) to gather analytics about the site's usage. In Matomo we only archive aggregate data that can't be traced back to individual users.
However, TVmaze uses external services such as Google Adsense. Google Adsense use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website or other websites. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting Ads Settings and read Google's privacy policy to see how they will process your data.
For users with a premium account all such external services are disabled.
