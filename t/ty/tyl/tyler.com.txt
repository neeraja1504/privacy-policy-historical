Privacy Statement-Ballistic Corporation
Ballistic Corporation Privacy Policy
Ballistic Corporation respects the privacy of users who visit each of the sites within the Ballistic Corporation network. No effort is made to identify individuals without their knowledge. The following policies are in effect for all of the Web pages owned and/or operated by Ballistic Corp. (The Ballistic Corp Network includes all sites constructed and/or hosted by Ballistic Web Design, Inc./Ballistic Action Net.)
When a visitor requests pages at any Ballistic Corp. site, our Web servers automatically recognize the browser's domain name, and IP address, operating system, browser type and version as well as the referring URL. Our servers do not record e-mail addresses. We collect the domain names and IP addresses in order to aggregate information on what pages users access or visit. This information is collected solely for statistical purposes and is not used to identify individuals.
From time to time, our advertisers may ask users to provide their e-mail address or mailing address for the purpose of a survey or to provide additional services (for example, subscriptions to print publications, or information about trade shows). Whenever the identity of a visitor is recorded, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the request before the information is requested. If you choose to supply your postal address in an online form, you may receive mailings from other reputable companies, but only if specifically requested.
From time to time, Ballistic Corp. or its advertisers may send a cookie to your computer. This information is collected for statistical purposes, or to enhance a website visitors experience. Ballistic Corp. does not collect information to be sold or distributed to outside parties from those websites within the Ballistic network.
E-newsletter Privacy Policy
Ballistic Corporation maintains a strict "no-spam" policy. Your e-mail address will not be sold to a third party if you sign up for one of our e-newsletters or discussion lists.
If you sign up for an e-mail newsletter or discussion list at a Ballistic Corp. site, you will receive only the e-mail newsletter or discussion list you have requested. You may receive on occasion an offer to sign up for a new newsletter or discussion list, but you will not receive additional newsletters or discussion list mailings unless you specifically request them. This is known as "Opt-In" rather than "Opt-Out".
