7. Use of Cookies
Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive to identify previous visitors to the Sites. Cookies are text files that can be rejected or deleted by you at any time. You may disable cookies using your Internet browser settings. However, by deleting or rejecting cookies, you may inhibit the user experience on the CPO Sites and other sites. For example, in order to complete online transactions, cookies must be accepted.
CPO uses cookies to store information about your visit to the CPO Sites in order to enhance your visit to the CPO Sites. For example, storing that information will allow us to, on occasion, customize account pages for you. We also use cookies and tracking technologies to:
Track user visits.
Track your shopping cart and purchases.
Determine what set-ups are most frequently rendered.
Save your password so you do not have to provide it each time you visit CPO Sites.
In addition, we currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize the CPO Sites. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our sites. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on the CPO Sites. The type of information we collect includes which pages are visited, which products are put into the shopping cart, which orders enter the checkout process, which checkouts are executed with payment, etc. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company manages the information coming from our sites on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our sites, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of our ability to analyze such data by contacting us (see Section 12).
8. Security
CPO and authorized third parties employ reasonable measures, including administrative, technical, and physical measures, to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, loss, alteration, use or disclosure. For example, any Personal Information you enter when you place an order for a product, including, without limitation, your credit card and other Personal Information, is encrypted before transmission to CPO Sites servers by using Secure Sockets Layer 128-bit encryption, if supported by your browser. In addition, we use reasonable measures to limit the disclosure of your Personal Information consistent with this privacy policy. However, your Personal Information can never be 100% secure: information may be transmitted over networks without appropriate security measures and may be accessed, deleted, altered, used or disclosed by unauthorized persons. You can help us to protect your Personal Information by (i) not sharing your password or other account information with others, (ii) using a secure web browser, and (iii) changing your password frequently.
9. Managing Your Information
CPO reserves the right to retain any Personal Information reasonably necessary to appropriately document its business activities and for archival and record retention purposes.

You may "opt-out" of receiving future email or other communications from us by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any email that you receive from us, or by contacting us (see Section 12). Please note that removal of your Personal Information from our database or "opting-out" will not stop (i) marketing or advertising content that is ready to be mailed or is queued for transmission to you prior to the time when we can implement your request, or (ii) the use of your Personal Information by third parties with whom CPO may have already shared your information.
