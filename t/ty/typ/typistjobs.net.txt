The Cash4Offers.com has developed the web technology to enable businesses to interact with consumers in highly personalized ways without forfeiting the privacy of the consumer. Privacy is a critical element of The Cash4Offers.com. Our Privacy Policy is an evolving document and as such will be updated periodically. We welcome feedback about the guidelines outlined in our policy.
The Cash4Offers.com will control all information collected as a result of your membership in The Cash4Offers.com. We do not give, sell, rent, share, or trade any identifiable personal information regarding our members to any third party.
In our online registration form, we require you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself including full name, address, and e-mail address. We then require that our members complete a short demographic profile. We will process this information to administer your membership and to enable you to take advantage of other member benefits. We will process this membership and demographic information to build a profile of your interests and activities so that we can send you advertisements, offers and other benefits that are most likely to be of interest to you. As we aggregate this type of information about all of our members, we do not disclose our members' names, addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, or other personally identifiable information to any third parties.
We may ask you for personal information at other times, including, but not limited to, when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by The Cash4Offers.com and/or when you report a problem with any of our services. Personal information gathered in this way will be used solely for the transaction itself unless otherwise specifically explained at the time the information is collected. The Cash4Offers.com may retain and reference aggregate information about member preferences gathered in these ways.

You can also delete cookie files from your computer at your discretion. Note that if you decline our cookies or ask for notification each time a cookie is being sent, you will need to input your username and password each time you visit The Cash4Offers.com site.
We use your e-mail address to verify your identity and protect against fraud and to contact you when necessary. In addition, we may choose to occasionally send targeted e-mail to our subscribed members. These direct e-mail messages usually contain some sort of sale, special or promotion that we are offering. Please note that these messages are sent out on a periodic basis and we will select a certain segment of our member base to contact based on the demographic profile that we are targeting. If you would not like to receive these periodic e-mails, you may cancel your membership from member control panel.
If a member elects to use our affiliate e-mail to refer a friend, we ask them for the friend's e-mail address. The Cash4Offers.com will send a one-time invitation to visit the site. We do not store the e-mail address after the invitation is sent. The referred friend may contact us with any questions or concerns.
The Cash4Offers.com may share non-personal aggregate, or summary, information regarding its customers with partners or other third parties. Further, we can - and you authorize us to - disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.
