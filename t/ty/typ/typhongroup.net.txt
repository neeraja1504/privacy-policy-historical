Typhon Group does not track individual personal information during visits to our public-facing web sites. To maintain peak performance levels, we log overall site and page visit statistics, or the "traffic". Information such as the date and time of the visit, the operating system, the Internet browser used, and other non-identifiable information is automatically logged. This information is for our internal use only.
Any information in e-mails sent to us through these web sites are used only to respond, if necessary, to the sender’s inquiry, or, with the sender’s permission, to complete a client profile. Examples of this might include contact names, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers and such. Again, this information is for our internal use only.
Customers of the service will be using the site to host data and information. Typhon Group will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such data except as may be required by law. Individual records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or as may be required by law. Of course, customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password.
Typhon Group's student tracking systems do not track any HIPAA protected health information (PHI) of patients entered.
Typhon Group agrees to abide by each school’s policy regarding the application of the federal law commonly known as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). FERPA prohibits the disclosure of a student’s education records. Each school agrees to release student names and other related information to Typhon with the understanding that Typhon will only use such information for its own purposes with regards to servicing the agreement with each school, and will not sell, release, or otherwise disseminate this information to any other entity.
