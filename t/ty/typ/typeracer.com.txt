TypeRacer Privacy Policy
www.typeracer.com
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, TypeRacer collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. TypeRacer's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how TypeRacer's visitors use its website. From time to time, TypeRacer may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
TypeRacer also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. TypeRacer does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to TypeRacer's websites choose to interact with TypeRacer in ways that require TypeRacer to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that TypeRacer gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at TypeRacer.com to provide a username, email address, and a date of birth (as a security measure for password retrieval). In each case, TypeRacer collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with TypeRacer. TypeRacer does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Notwithstanding anything else herein, we may partner with third party advertisers who may (themselves or through their partners) place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. These cookies enable more customized ads, content or services to be provided to you. To trigger these cookies, we may pass an encrypted or "hashed" (non-human readable) identifier corresponding to your email address to a Web advertising partner, who may place a cookie on your computer. No personally identifiable information is on, or is connected to, these cookies. To opt-out of these cookies, please go to http://www.privacychoice.org/choose
Aggregated Statistics
TypeRacer may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, TypeRacer may gather information about the number of races a user has participated in. TypeRacer may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, TypeRacer does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
