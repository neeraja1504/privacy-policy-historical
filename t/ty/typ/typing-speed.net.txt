|  SCREENENETWORK - PRIVACY POLICY This privacy policy applies to most of our websites. We respect the privacy of our visitors and surfers. We do not sell, barter or exchange email addresses you give us when sending a greeting unless a visitor has given us explicit permission to do so. We collect aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit. The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web page, and may be disclosed when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Website and applicable laws or to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Website.
We reserve the right to provide information if we think - correctly or incorrectly and reasonably or unreasonably - that our greetings, ecards, quiz cards, wishafriend greetings and comments, screensavers and/or wallpapers are being used in violation of our terms of use, including, but not limited to, being used in any illegal, harmful, threatening or anti-social activity.
We try to protect your privacy, but please understand that any use of the Internet or of email creates the possibility that someone could access the data transmitted. There is always some risk on the web that personal information might be accessed and privacy cannot be guaranteed.
