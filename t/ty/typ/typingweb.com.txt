Privacy Policy - Typing.com
Privacy Policy Updated: September 2019
Typing.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. This privacy policy applies to information, including personal information, that Typing.com (a product of Teaching.com) collects about you when you visit our website. This policy does not apply to other Teaching.com websites or apps.
Typing.com offers both a free (Student and Teacher), ad-supported version and a premium (Student and Teacher), subscription-based version. The personal information that we collect, use, share, and disclose is dependent upon the version utilized.
While most of Typing.com is a general audience website through which we do not knowingly collect information from children under 13, the teacher portal portion of our site contains features for teachers (such as grading and reporting on performance) designed for students who may be Children.
Information We Collect
We collect information from you directly when you create an account.

Sharing and Use of Information
We use the information described above to communicate with you, manage and improve our site, and for security purposes. Except as provided below, we will not sell, share, or disclose information we collect from or about you. Our site uses  Google Analytics.

Any advertisements served by Google may be controlled using the DoubleClick cookie which allows Google to display ads based on your visits to this and other sites.
