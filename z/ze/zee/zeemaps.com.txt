When you upload data from a Cloud Drive Spreadsheet, e.g., Google GDrive or Microsoft’s OneDrive, we only read information from your spreadsheet to place information on your maps. We do not modify your Cloud Drive spreadsheet in any way. We might ask you to provide us with your email address when you access the cloud drive spreadsheet, so we can inform you about the status of your data upload to the maps. The Cloud Drive spreadsheet data is not used in any other way except to place the information on your maps.
Without your express approval, however, Zee Source will not trade, sell or rent your personal information but may collect and/or provide aggregate statistics about its Web site and users to other parties.
When you view certain parts of the Web site, information may be stored on your computer. This information will be in the form of a “Cookie” or similar file and will permit tailoring of the Web site to better match your interests and/or preferences.
