To do that, we've set up procedures to ensure that your information is handled responsibly and in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws. We're grateful for your trust, and we'll act that way.
This privacy policy describes what information we collect when you visit our services, how we use that information, and what choices we offer you to access, update, and control it. We only ask you for personal information when we truly need it. We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.

If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact us at privacy@zenkit.com.
1. Why does Zenkit need my information?
Zenkit products are web and mobile device based; because of this they may require the use of first and last names, billing contact information, a password and a valid email address as a login. Therefore, at a minimum, we may require such necessary information in order to establish your account with us. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Like most website operators, Zenkit collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Zenkit’s purpose in collecting this information is to better understand how visitors use Zenkit. Zenkit may collect potentially personally-identifying information like IP addresses for users who create, edit or contribute to content on the website.
2. Information gathered/tracked by Zenkit
PERSONAL INFORMATION: Information gathered at www.zenkit.com is done so on a voluntary basis. We collect personal information from users including (at a minimum) first and last names, an email address to be used as a login, and a password as well as comments on blog postings and job and press inquiries. When a user registers online for our service, Zenkit will take steps to verify the email address supplied to us to ensure it is accurate. All paid services require Zenkit to collect billing contact information and a credit card number which will also be verified to ensure it is accurate. Your email address may be used to send you periodic product newsletters, offers and usage tips from Zenkit. We use the collected information to deliver services, process payments, update our records, communicate with you about products and services, and generally maintain your accounts with us. Because of our commitment to present the best possible product to all our users, we track all information pertaining to user satisfaction. To ensure the quality of our product, we reserve the right to maintain evaluation and feedback records.
You are advised that you may obtain some services of the provider, for example a newsletter, without providing personal information. In this case only an email address is needed. Furthermore, you can give an anonymous email address, from a free email service, so that your email address appears as a pseudonym instead of as a first and last name. Pursuant to Sections 34 and its following articles, and Article 6b of the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, BDSG), the user can always view the personal data saved under their name or pseudonym free of charge. For this, the user only needs to make a written request to the provider.
In order to determine the extent to which the website is of interest and can be improved, general, non-personally identifiable, and statistical data on the use of the services offered are collected and kept. In order to achieve this, surveys are conducted and data and information from server log files are summarized on a holistic basis and used for statistics and analysis.
BUSINESS INFORMATION: Information that is collected by our services is considered confidential Business Information. Business Information includes app data, task data, messages, files, and any other business information you provided when using the Zenkit services. We will collect and use Business Information only as necessary to appropriately support the service, for the purpose of anticipating, diagnosing, supporting or resolving any problems that might limit or disrupt the quality of our customers’ service experience or as required by law. We do not build or give access to administrative tools that would allow Zenkit employees to view business information. You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit to your Zenkit profile can be read, collected or used by others who share the same workspace(s) as you.
When you download and use our services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and information necessary to configure the application for your device and preferences. We collect geolocation data only if a user elects to provide it in conjunction with an activity such as creating a new table. You may opt-in to receive push notifications in order to alert you to messages, comments, tasks, items in which you are mentioned or referenced, subscribed events, workspace changes, or reminders you have set. You can change your notifications at any time in the app settings.
SECURITY INFORMATION: Zenkit also collects certain standard information about your computer for security and identification purposes. This information may include: IP addresses, domain names, access times, cookies and other unique identifying information of machines that have our software downloaded and installed on them. This information is used for the operation of the service, to identify and protect our customers and to control unauthorized use or abuse of our services. All information is encrypted during transmission and is stored securely within our servers.
WEB ANALYTICS: We continuously improve our site and utilize different analytic tools to help us do so, such as cookies. We are interested in how visitors use our products, what they like and dislike, and where they have problems.
GOOGLE ANALYTICS: We use Google Analytics as described in How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps. You can prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics on websites by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on here. We also employ IP address masking, a technique used to truncate IP addresses collected by Google Analytics and store them in an abbreviated form to prevent them from being traced back to individual users. Portions of our website may also use Google Analytics for Display Advertisers including DoubleClick or Dynamic Remarketing which provide interest-based ads based on your visit to this or other websites. You can use Ads Settings to manage the Google ads you see and opt-out of interest-based ads.

These stats help us to understand how people are interacting with our websites and to improve the design and functionality of our sites so that we can offer a better online experience to visitors and customers. If you visit Zenkit websites, a 3rd party StatCounter analytics cookie will be placed in your browser.

We may also use cookies in partnership with selected marketing companies to help us track the effectiveness of our websites, generate visitor traffic, or as part of a referral program.
We have no control over the use of third party tracking technologies after they are placed on our site. The Help section on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. You can still review the site if you choose to set your browser to refuse all cookies; however, you must enable cookies in order to establish an account and to download and install any of the software.
We use wordpress.org software to run the blog on Zenkit. If you comment on our blog, cookies will be set. This is for your convenience so that you will not have to re-type all your information for future comments.
SOCIAL MEDIA: Our site includes social media features, such as Google+ Sign-In, the Facebook Like button and Facebook Connect and Twitter. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These services will also authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this site to your profile page to share with others within your network. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.
