Information Collected Automatically and How We Use It
We do collect non-personally identifiable information ("Non-PII") to identify computers that we have interacted with before. For instance, by using Non-PII, we may be able to identify a computer that has previously visited our Website to see the available properties. In the context of Non-PII, whenever we refer to 'you' or 'yours', please remember that we may be referring to a computer and not an identifiable person since we generally do not know who is using a computer at any particular time.
Through the collection and use of Non-PII, we provide you with the best possible experience and to tailor our services to your interests and needs. Our purpose is to improve the overall quality of our Website and the services we provide and to help us to provide you faster navigation and access to the various sections of the Website.

Information You Provide To Us
We do not collect personally identifiable information ("PII") from users online unless users affirmatively and deliberately choose to release that information by submitting it by way of registering on our Website. Our registration process request for certain personal information such as name, phone number, e-mail address as well as certain property information in order to assist you in effectively transmitting your expression of interest in our service. By providing us with voluntary PII, you consent to our using the data subject to applicable law. We may use the PII provided by you, to meet your needs and fulfill the request for information you submit, for follow up communications and to send you information services or updates and other information we think may be of interest to you. If you tell us (by accessing opt-out procedure described below) that you do not want us to use the PII information as a basis for any further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.
Disclosure of Information to Third Parties
We may disclose a user's Non-PII and PII when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal obligation, in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or in special cases when we reasonably believe that disclosing your PII and Non PII is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including, but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or to protect and defend Zenify's rights, interests or property. In addition and if permitted by applicable law we may also disclose and provide access to a user's PII and Non-PII to our vendors and contractors who are performing the services on our behalf. However, such vendors and contractors are not permitted to use such user information for any purpose other than providing services to us.
