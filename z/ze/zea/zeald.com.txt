We also use third party service providers (for example, Google) to help us track the effectiveness of our website, generate visitor traffic and to display targeted advertising.    These advertisements may collect anonymous information about your visits to the website on which such advertisement is placed, your interaction with these ads and the products and services offered by us and others through the use of a cookie (such as a Google Analytics or Double Click cookie) pixel tag or other web technologies.  We, Google and other selected marketing organisations and may use this anonymous information to inform, optimise and provide targeted advertisements to you.
Our website may also contain links and advertisements which link to third party websites.  We have no control over the privacy policies of such third parties and we encourage you to review such policies prior to providing any information to or purchasing goods or services from such third parties.
2. How we use information collected
We may use the personal information collected by us for the following purposes:

for the purposes identified in any specific supplemental privacy notice posted on the page or area of our website where you provided that information.
We will ask for your consent before using personal information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.
We may use anonymous or ‘non-personally identifiable’ information:

We store and process information (both personal and non-personally identifiable information) on servers in several different countries around the world, including New Zealand, Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom.  We may, therefore, hold or process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.  Information held in another country may be subject to the privacy laws of that country and may permit government and other regulatory authorities to access such information in certain circumstances.
3. Information Zeald shares
Ensuring and respecting your privacy is important to us.  We do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share your personal information with third parties unless one of the following circumstances apply:
With your consent:  We may share personal information with third parties when we have your express consent to do so.
​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ With your employer:  If your employer is our customer and your interactions with us or use of our services is in the course of your employment, your employer will have access to the information you have provided to us (including records of communications, login information and other data).
With our contractors and service providers: We sometimes engage other trusted businesses and persons to provide services and perform functions on our behalf (for example, our digital business specialists, content specialists and credit card providers).  We may provide such persons with access to personal information needed to perform their functions, based on our instructions and in accordance with appropriate security, privacy and confidentiality measures.
Jointly provided services:  In some cases, we may provide services jointly with other businesses or organisations.  For such ‘co-branded’ offerings in which a third party is involved, we may share or jointly collect customer information with that third party.  In such cases, we will make it clear at the outset who is collecting or receiving the information and whose privacy statement governs its use.
For legal purposes: We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect or enforce our rights, to protect against harm or the rights, property or safety of others or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us.
Also, in the event that Zeald or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, our customer information will be one of the transferred assets.  In that case, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and will give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Occasionally we may send information or offers to you on behalf of other organisations or businesses.  When we do this, however, we do not share your personal information with those other organisations or businesses.
We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our contractors, service providers and other third parties such as marketing, search and research organisations, for example, Google.

7. How we retain your personal information
We retain personal information regarding you for as long as your account is active, to provide you with the services contracted. We also retain personal information for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, for example, to comply with our legal obligations, to protect us in the event of disputes and to enforce our agreements and to protect our and others’ interests.
The precise periods for which we keep your personal information vary depending on the nature of the information and why we need it. Factors we consider in determining these periods include the minimum required retention period prescribed by law or recommended as best practice, the period during which a claim can be made with respect to an agreement or other matter, whether the personal information has been aggregated or pseudonymised, and other relevant criteria. For example, the period we keep your email address is connected to how long your account is active, while the period for which we keep a support message is based on how long has passed since the last submission in the thread.
You may have a seasonal site or come back to us after an account becomes inactive, we don’t immediately delete your personal information if you cancel all services. Instead, we keep your personal information for a reasonable period of time, so it will be there for you if you come back.
You may delete your account by contacting us at accounts@zeald.com and Zeald will delete the personal information it holds about you (unless we need to retain it for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy).
Please note that in the course of providing our services, we collect and maintain aggregated, anonymised or de-personalised information which we may retain indefinitely.
