HBC is protecting your privacy
For over 335 years, Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) has been a name that means trust in this country. We value you as our customer, and want to assure you that our 70,000 associates are committed to upholding the trust you've placed in us as Canada's oldest corporation and largest department store retailer.
HBC's Principles for the Protection of Personal Information were created to ensure we preserve the confidentiality, accuracy and security of your personal information. These principles guide us in the collection, use, retention and disclosure of your personal information in all of our HBC family of stores and services: the Bay, Zellers, Home Outfitters, Fields, HBC Credit, HBC Rewards and HBC Insurance.
The information that we collect
Personal information means any information about an identifiable individual. This includes information such as your name, address, telephone number, birth date, purchase information or e-mail address. As a customer, you provide HBC with this information in a variety of ways, such as when making a purchase, applying for an HBC Credit Card, enrolling in our HBC Rewards program, entering in-store contests or signing up for our Gift Registry program. In every case, HBC adheres to strict guidelines when dealing with your personal information.
Collecting your Personal Information
HBC collects and uses personal information in connection with providing you with goods and services.
When you provide HBC with personal information, we will inform you as to why we are collecting it.
HBC obtains your consent for the collection of your personal information. In some instances, where the purpose for collection is obvious, your consent is implied.
HBC will ask for your permission to collect additional information that may be useful in serving you in the future.
Using and Disclosing your Personal Information
HBC only uses and discloses your personal information for the marketing purposes identified to you when your consent to the collection of your personal information was obtained.
HBC does not provide your personal information for marketing purposes of other organizations without your consent.
You can withdraw, at any time, your consent for the use of your personal information that is not required for a transaction subject to legal restrictions and upon reasonable notice to HBC. Your information may be retained by HBC for audit or archival purposes.
Maintaining and Safeguarding your Personal Information
HBC strives to ensure that our security measures protect against loss, theft and unauthorized access, use, disclosure or modification of your personal information.
HBC limits access to your personal information to those HBC associates who may need it for use in accordance with HBC's established privacy principles.
HBC associates sign an annual Code of Conduct, which requires them to keep your personal information confidential and comply with our security standards.
HBC keeps your information for as long as necessary to accomplish the identified purpose and in order to serve you better. Your information is then destroyed according to legislative requirements.
You are Entitled to Access your Personal Information
If you request access to your personal information, HBC will respond to your request within 30 days.
There is no cost for reasonable requests unless you require copies of records. HBC will advise you of the cost, if any, prior to copying those records.
HBC may not be able to provide you with access to your personal information where the information cannot be separated from the records of others, cannot be disclosed for reasons of security or commercial confidentiality, or is protected by legal privilege.
Hbc Provides you with the Answers

Frequently Asked Questions
Q: What is "personal information"?
A: "Personal information" is any information about an identifiable individual. This includes information such as a person's name, address and phone number.
Q: Do I have to give HBC my personal information in order to conduct business with HBC?
A:There are several instances where you are required to give us your personal information for operational and/or administrative purposes. For example, we require your personal information in order to manage your HBC Rewards account, deliver an item to you that you may have purchased, or maintain your gift registry. Giving us your personal information for these kinds of primary operational purposes is necessary to obtain certain products and services from HBC.
However, agreeing to the use of your personal information for additional secondary marketing purposes is entirely up to you. You may contact our Privacy Office at any time to request that we not use your personal information for marketing purposes.
Q: What are the differences between primary and secondary purposes of personal information collection?
Secondary purposes are any purposes that are over and above the primary/operational purposes, like sending you communications that may include notifications of sales, special events, store promotions and exclusive offers.
Q:Will I be advised of the collection purposes prior to giving my consent?
A: Yes. When you fill out an HBC form that asks for your personal information (e.g. gift registry form, HBC Rewards enrollment form, etc.) there is a privacy notice that outlines both our primary and secondary purposes for collecting your information.
Q:Why is it important to keep HBC up to date with regards to my personal information?
A: Keeping your personal information as accurate and up-to-date as possible ensures that you will get the best possible information and service offerings from HBC.
Q: What are my opt-out choices?
A: You can opt-out of receiving communications via specific contact channels. For example, you can choose to no longer receive marketing-related phone calls, but you may choose to continue receiving notification of sales and exclusive offers in the mail. However, you may not be able to restrict your communications to specific programs. Contact our Privacy Office for more details on your opt-out choices.
Q: If I opt-out, how long will it take to stop receiving marketing materials after I contact you?
A: Many will stop immediately or within days, while others may take longer.
Q: May I review the personal information HBC has about me? Can I obtain copies of that information?
A: Yes. You can review the personal information we have about you on file by contacting our Privacy Office. There is no cost for reasonable requests for access to your personal information, but there may be a fee to supply you with copies of records. We will advise you of the fee, if any, at the time of your request.
Q: Where can I get a copy of HBC's Customer Privacy Brochure?
