Please be aware, however, that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of the idlecast.com Platform - such as when you publish content, comments or profile information - becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction.
idlecast.com may disclose Automatically Collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist such parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, or other functionality of idlecast.com.
We may disclose some limited User information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist idlecast.com in improving the idlecast.com Platform and creating new services features. We require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures.
idlecast.com may disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.

Advertisers
idlecast.com may allow advertisers, third party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements directly to you within the idlecast.com site, services and software. By serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set their own cookies on your computer and trigger their own Web beacons to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. idlecast.com does not provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks idlecast.com to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, males age 15 to 18) or audience segment (for example, males age 15 to 18 who have participated in certain promotions) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks.
Some of these companies are participants in the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), a cooperative of online marketing and analytic companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. You can learn more about NAI and how you may "opt out" of targeted advertising delivered by NAI member ad networks here:
http://www.networkadvertising.org/.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. idlecast.com reserves the right the add or remove third-party ad networks or ad servers in its discretion and idlecast.com may not at all times list such updated ad network or ad server partners in this Privacy Policy.
Our Commitment to Data Security

We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to idlecast.com, and you do so at your own risk.

However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
