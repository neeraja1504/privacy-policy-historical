2. Aadhaar user consent policy
Voluntary Act
The act of providing your Aadhaar is voluntary in nature, which will only be required for completing your account opening procedure online and for digitally signing the Zerodha account opening form. You may alternatively choose to go through the offline route of account opening by physically signing all such account opening documents, which does not require you to share your Aadhaar information.
Zerodha does not store any Aadhaar information
During your online account opening process, you do not input any Aadhaar details on the Zerodha platform. You would be issuing your Digital Aadhaar to Digilocker, from where Zerodha (Zerodha is registered as a Requester on the Digilocker platform) would receive information limited to: (1) The last four digits of your Aadhaar / VID (Virtual ID created on the UIDAI website), (2) Full Name, (3) Date of Birth, (4) Gender, (5) Address, and (6) Your Photo.
Digilocker is a part of the National eGovernance Division under the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India. The Digital Aadhaar issued within DigiLocker is the same as the eAadhaar issued by UIDAI (https://eaadhaar.uidai.gov.in). DigiLocker has partnered with UIDAI to make it available automatically to its users when they link their DigiLocker account with Aadhaar.
This act of issuing an eAadhaar within Digilocker and subsequently Digilocker sharing the information limited to the above points, leads to behaving as a physical KYC. Zerodha only receives information limited to the above points for the purposes of completing KYC of clients online. All clients may alternatively follow the offline route of account opening, which does not require sharing any Aadhaar related information.
During your online account opening process, you would also be sharing your Aadhaar with Digiotech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. for the purpose of digitally signing the Zerodha account opening form. Digiotech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. does not share your Aadhaar with Zerodha. After the account opening form has been digitally signed by you, a copy of the digitally signed form would be email to you and to Zerodha for reference purposes.
Digiotech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. is a licensed e-Sign ASP (Application Services Provider) with CDAC, compliant with the guidelines laid down by the Controller of Certifying Authorities (CCA), India and UIDAI, to enable you to eSign the account opening forms online.
Storage of any Aadhaar related data
After the voluntary completion of your online account opening using Aadhaar, the last four digits of your Aadhaar number along with the information mentioned above, if any received, will be stored in Zerodha's encrypted Aadhaar Vault system in accordance with the UIDAI Circular dated July 25, 2017.
