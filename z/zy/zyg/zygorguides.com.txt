Updated May 25th, 2018
Here at Zygor Guides we value your privacy and it is our policy to make it clear what data we collect and how we use it, as well give you full control over this data.
The Data We Collect:
When you create a Zygor Account we collect and store the following information.
On our local server we collect and store:
Your username, first and last name, and email address. Passwords are not stored and are encrypted in a way that can only be used for login purposes and thus cannot be retrieved in the event of a security breach.
If you choose to link your social media and/or discord accounts (completely optional) we are able to access select profile information through those third party services. You will be shown what info we will gain access to and be asked for approval before any accounts are linked.
Almost all user interactivity on the site is handled via cookies stored locally on each users device. Additionally, we track user behavior and interaction using Google and Facebook tracking pixels.
If you purchase a Zygor Elite subscription our payment processor Recurly collects and stores:
Your Payment info and your billing address. If you use Paypal only a "token" is stored rather than your full info. This information is not stored locally on our servers but externally on Recurly's servers. Recurly is GDPR complaint as of May 25th.
Additionally, when you sign up for an account your email is automatically added to our Aweber (third party mailing list service) newsletter.
Usage statistics:
We monitor and store access logs to our server and install client. Our client is able to track and send us anonymous usage statistics about which guides you install and use.
Why We Collect and Store This Data
The data on our local server is used to create an account profile for customers, grant access to consumer products, and allow users to use website features such as the forums and user feedback sections.
The data stored through our third party payment processor Recurly is used to bill and process monthly payments for premium consumer services like Zygor Elite.
Users are auto-enrolled to our newsletter in order to provide important information about our products and services.
Usage statistics are used to determine the size of our user base and which products are most popular in order to focus our efforts.
Your access patterns (dates, IP addresses, browser versions) are also stored for security reasons and fraud protection.
Cookies are used to handle user logins and keep them logged in as they use the site. They are also used to track when affiliates send traffic to our site that results in a sale in order to provide commissions.
Google tracking pixels are used for Google Analytics to learn more about user behavior and test the sales effectiveness of individual pages. Facebook tracking pixels are used to test the sales results of Zygor ads running on Facebook.
Your Data and Privacy Options:
All locally stored information can be edited manually through the website.
Through our support ticket system you can request changes to the information stored by our payment processor, and/or request that your account be closed and all your data completely removed both locally and through Recurly. This will be done promptly and you will be notified when this process is complete. We are also working on adding ways that you can do all of this manually as well.
You can unsubscribe from our newsletter by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of each email.
How We Protect Your Data:
The portions of our website used for account registration are secured via SSL. Billing information is stored solely on Recurly's servers and is never actually transmitted through our servers, thus reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.
All information stored at Recurly uses the highest security which can be read about here: https://recurly.com/security/
If there is ever a security breach we will notify you and let you know what we're doing to make sure it doesn't happen again.
We will also routinely audit and update our policies to make sure they meet the highest privacy standards.
