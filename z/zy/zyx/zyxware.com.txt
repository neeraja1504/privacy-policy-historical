Required fields are marker * Cherry (not verified) access_time 03 Jul 2019 - 02:58 Why are the days picked out and chosen for employees? There are 12 days mentioned here. Why not give people ( employees) the option of choosing any 12 days of their liking for personal holidays so that the company doesn’t dictate terms on their personal religious inclinations ? If sufficiently early notice is provided, things can be planned for as well. Also, why is this on the public website and not a private internal employee webpage ? Cheers, Cherry Anoop John (not verified) access_time 03 Jul 2019 - 02:58 1) Since the number of employees are still small it is difficult to manage operations with the optional holidays model. If a certain combination of employees do not come to office on a particular day even if that be only 6/12 or 7/12 people the company will not be able to function properly on that day. In a larger company this might not cause any problem because of the cushion of larger number of employees. 2) In the longer run we will be moving to the optional holiday pattern with a set of fixed holidays and a set of optional holidays. 3) This is on the public site for 2 reasons - a) Open documentation policy :). b) Customers/Clients can know ahead the holidays of the company. Cherry (not verified) access_time 03 Jul 2019 - 02:58 1) I guess you know the logistics better, but having a situation where employees feel committed enough to the company to be flexible about their holidays seems a good deal of a better work situation than having rules set in stone. This would be especially true when the example is set from the ‘top’, whatever that is. 2) Good luck with this. 3) Open Documentation: Even open source projects have “internal” mailing lists. All the BSDs have them, most of the bazaar model’s have “rings” where private email resolves “internal” issues. I don’t think it is a good precedent. Add new comment
