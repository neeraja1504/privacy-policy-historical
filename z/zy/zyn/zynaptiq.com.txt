What is personal data?
Personal data means any information relating to you that, directly or indirectly, may be used to identify you, for example your name and your e-mail address. Information such as your IP-number and your user behavior when using the Website may also be personal data.
Who is responsible for processing your personal data?
When your personal data is being processed by us for our purposes, in the way set out in this Privacy Policy, Zynaptiq GmbH, registered with number HRB 208004 at Amtsgericht Hannover, is the data controller regarding such processing.
If you have any questions about our processing of your personal data or your rights connected hereto, you can always contact us.
Which sources for personal data about you do we have, and which data do we receive from them?
Most of the personal data that we process about you is information that you have chosen to provide to us.
We gather such information about you when:
* You order a trial version of our software. We deliver download information per email, for which you must provide a valid address for an email account to which you have access. You must also select the operating system for which you wish to use the software. You may also optionally provide additional information such as your name, your preferred host application, and your main field of work. You may subscribe to our email newsletter when ordering a trial version.
* You register your software. After purchasing a zynaptiq software product, you must register your software in order to receive download URLs as well as license activation codes; you can not use our software without registration. When you register your software, you must provide your name, a valid address for an email account to which you have access, as well as the registration code provided by your dealer. In addition, we log the IP address from which the registration was performed, along with a timestamp, and information about the browser and OS used to perform the registration.
* You navigate this website; our content management system will create access log files that may contain information about your IP address, operating system, browser, the date and time of the access request, and the pages you visited. We rarely use this information; when we do, it typically relates mainly to evaluating website usability, functionality and security.
* You contact us in any way (for example contacting our customer service or at social media channels). We may gather whatever information you provide to us voluntarily and thus assumedly with consent.
We receive such data about you from third parties when:

To use our software – all license types, including full, NFR and trials – you must have an account with PACE Anti-Piracy, Inc., a third-party company based outside of the EU/EEA, also known as "iLok". This account is used to identify you as licensed user of and provide access to our software, and stores your software licenses for you (and us). You activate our software by adding a license file to your iLok account – our software will then verify its licensing status by querying your iLok account (when activating to HD or via cloud), or an attached iLok2 or iLok 3 USB key, for a valid license. In order for us to be able to adminsistrate your licenses, provide support, and generally implement our contractual obligations to you in context of your software license, PACE provides us with that part of your data which relates directly to your licenses to our software, such as Name, email address, IP Address, and a list of and status for your Zynaptiq licenses, as well as information about the name and OS of any computers you use with our licenses. Such account can be created at the third-party website www.ilok.com , which is owned and maintained by PACE Anti-Piracy, Inc. , and which is subject to their own Privacy Policy, which you should evaluate before registering an account, at https://www.ilok.com/#!privacy-policy, and https://www.ilok.com/#!terms-of-use. Also, as a convenience, our software's activation window provides the option to launch your browser and open the iLok.com website should you need to activate the software and not yet have an iLok account; please note that when cerating such an account at ilok.com, you are doing so at a third-party site and providing data to a third party, under the terms of their Privacy Policy and Terms Of Use.
