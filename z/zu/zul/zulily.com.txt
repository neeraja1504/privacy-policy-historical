Privacy Policy | zulily
This website is owned and operated by zulily, inc. (“zulily”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). We respect the privacy of our customers and visitors to our website. This Notice of Privacy Practices (“Notice”) describes the privacy practices we follow in connection with this website, including our mobile applications and related consumer services (collectively, the “Services”). It also describes the options you have regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information. By using our Services and/or registering as a zulily member, you are accepting the privacy practices described in this Notice and consenting to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as described below.
This Notice applies only to information collected by zulily and any related entity of zulily (“Affiliate”) posting this Notice. This Notice does not apply to the privacy practices of our business partners, vendors, co-branded sites, other third parties, or to any services offered through other websites where a different privacy notice is posted. Please consult the privacy information on the sites of third parties with which you may come into contact when using our Services. Their privacy notices, not ours, apply to information that they collect and use.
Information We Collect
The personal information we collect about you may include, for example, your name, zulily user name and password, postal shipping and billing addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, social networking information (such as user names, handles, and friends lists), information about contacts provided by you or information in your address book, demographic information (such as date of birth, age and gender), photos you send us, payment information (including credit card numbers or online payment services numbers), financial information (such as bank account numbers), products you may select as favorites and share, purchase history and location information (often from the device on which you access the Services). You may also submit additional personal information to us in other ways, such as participating in online surveys, promotions, contests and sweepstakes and other offerings made available through our Services. We may combine information we receive from third parties with the information we receive based on your use of the Services and any other interactions with us.
In addition to the information you submit to us on this website or when using the Services, information regarding your use of and interactions with our Services is collected and/or aggregated by or on behalf of zulily, often through the use of automated means. Such information may include, for example, data that we gather and store about your visit to and use of the Services, such as your IP address and the location of your IP server, device IDs, device type, wi-fi connection information, geo-location data, product search history, type of browser and operating system used, date and time you access the Services, pages you visit, and if you came to the Services from another website, the address of that website.
Cookies and web beacons are sometimes used to collect and track this customer usage information. “Cookies” are small identifiers sent from a web server that are stored on your device’s hard drive for the purpose of identifying your browser during interactions on websites or storing information or settings in your browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. We can also use web beacons to tell if you have opened or acted upon emails that we send you.
In addition to the cookies and web beacons we deliver and use, we allow others including certain third-party analytics service providers to use cookies, web beacons, APIs (application programming interfaces), SDKs (software development kits), and other tracking tools on our Services on our behalf and to retain and use de-identified usage data received from such tracking tools for their own purposes. We also allow third parties to use usage data and tracking tools for advertising purposes as described in the Advertising Network section below. These third parties may collect information or may help us collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites, applications, and devices when you use our Services or third party websites and mobile apps that display our ads.
How We May Use the Information We Collect
We may use the personal information we collect from our customers for a variety of purposes, including, for example:
to accomplish ordinary business purposes, such as establishing and managing customer accounts, responding to inquiries, providing requested products and services, processing and collecting payments and providing customer support;
to provide information about our business and offer our products or services to you and products and services of others that we think you may find of interest;
to communicate about, and administer your participation in, special events, programs, surveys, contests, sweepstakes and other offers or promotions;
to enable you to interact with zulily and our customers through our message boards, blogs and social media;
to evaluate and improve our business, including developing new products and services, identifying potential new customers, analyzing the effectiveness of advertising and marketing promotions and other aspects of our Services, and soliciting your feedback through email communications, telephone calls, and/or focus groups;
to create a profile of you and your interests, so that we may personalize your shopping experience, ads, and the manner in which we interact with you;
to perform data analyses, including market and consumer research, trend analysis, demographic analysis and financial analysis; and
to protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity and to comply with legal information requests, applicable legal requirements and our policies and practices.
We may also use personal information in other ways for which we provide notice at the time of collection as may be required by applicable laws, or without notice to you for any legally permissible purpose and subject to applicable laws.
Third Party Applications
We may include applications from third parties on this website or through our Services, which allow interaction or content sharing by users. Some of these mini-programs provide specific services or content from a third party, such as a Facebook “Share” or “Like” button, and are visible to you when you visit our Services. Your interaction with these programs typically allows the third party to collect some information about you through cookies they place on your device and other tracking mechanisms. In some cases, the third party may recognize you through its cookies even when you do not interact with their application. Please visit the third parties’ respective privacy policies to better understand their data collection practices and controls they make available to you.
Advertising Networks
We partner with advertising networks, which are companies that deliver targeted advertisements to consumers and generate statistics and metrics related to the delivery of such advertisements. They use information collected through cookies (including first party cookies and third party cookies), web server logs, web beacons, and mobile app plugins such as SDKs (software development kits), APIs (application programming interfaces) and similar technologies to provide customized advertisements, auditing, research, and reporting for us and other advertisers. This data collection takes place on our website and through our mobile applications, on other third-party websites you visit, and third party mobile applications you use that participate in the advertising networks. This process enhances the deployment of our marketing programs and helps us to track the effectiveness of such efforts. Advertising networks we use may also use this information for determining or predicting your characteristics and preferences and those of their respective advertising audiences, for measuring services, including determining the effectiveness of advertising, delivering relevant ads, and for other purposes. You can learn more about ad serving companies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative website and Facebook’s ad preferences tool and privacy policy.

You may also share with zulily contact information of friends and people in your address book so that we can help you invite others to become zulily members or let them know about special offers and help facilitate deliveries. Please be mindful of your own privacy needs and those of others as you choose with whom to connect, what you share with us and others, and what you make public. We cannot control the privacy of information you choose to make public or share with others.

If you choose to remove cookies, you may remove opt-out cookies that affect your advertising preferences.
