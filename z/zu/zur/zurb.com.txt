IP address
You make the decision whether to proceed with our request for your PII. However, if you decide not to provide the requested information, we will be unable to respond.
You warrant and promise that you're 13 years of age or older. ZURB does not intend to collect PII from anyone under the age of 13 (or 16, if you are a citizen of the EU).
How We Use Your Personal Information
When you request information from ZURB regarding our Services or any of our Products, we use PII for the purpose of communicating with you, including:
Responding to your request.
Providing customer support.
Send you security alerts and promotional emails.
Data Sharing
ZURB will not sell PII to anyone. One exception would be only in the event that ZURB or any of its Intellectual Property is sold. In this case we would transfer PII to the buyer in order for them to continue to provide the same great ZURB service.
ZURB may disclose to authorized law enforcement personnel, PII from anyone who poses a threat. This might include those that are attempting to commit fraud or those who conduct activities that could bring harm to others. We assume that this is not you so please don’t worry.
Occasionally, we may share PII with our selected business partners for the purpose of providing improved services. If you prefer that we not provide your PII to our business partners, let us know by using one of the methods described below in this policy. We also might retain the services of outside contractors for the purpose of providing training services, technical support, to develop improved services, handle order processing or to perform other services. We require that these contractors maintain the same level of security and confidentiality that ZURB does.
We provide a number of ways for you to “opt-out” of receiving additional information from us or having us provide your PII to our partners. We may offer you these choices at the time you give us your information. Users who no longer wish to receive our promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to a promotional email communication, writing “unsubscribe” in the subject line, or by simply emailing us at info@zurb.com.
Our Web pages may contain links to other sites. We do not share PII with those websites and are not responsible for their privacy policies. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.
