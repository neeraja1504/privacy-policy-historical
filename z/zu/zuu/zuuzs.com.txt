What Data We Collect and Why
The information we learn from our Members helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping and social experience at zuuzs.com.  We may collect Personal Information that can identify you (“Personal Information”) such as your name and email address as well as other information that does not identify you (“Anonymous Information”).  When you provide Personal Information through zuuzs.com, the information may be sent to servers located across the United States.  Below are the types of information we gather.
1. Information You Provide
We collect and store any Personal Information you submit to us voluntarily through zuuzs.com or provide to us in some other manner ( e.g. , creating/editing your Member profile, information entered in reviews, ratings, postings, comments, and forums). This includes identifying information, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, and profile picture, and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information).
We also may request information about your interests, activities, gender, age, and other demographic information, which we may share with advertisers on an anonymous basis.  If you sign up for surveys or other activities that we make available to you on zuuzs.com, we will collect the information designated along with such activity, which may include your contact information such as your address and phone number.  If you choose to sign up to receive information about products or services that may be of interest to you, we will collect your email address and other related information.
2. Information From Other Sources
A. Cookies and Other Technologies
We use cookies and other technologies, such as, web beacons (also known as “clear gifs” and “pixel tags”) to recognize you, customize your experience, and serve advertisements.   Cookies are very small files placed on your computer, and they allow us to count the number of visitors to zuuzs.com and distinguish repeat visitors from new visitors. They also allow us to save Member preferences and track Member trends. We rely on cookies for the proper operation of zuuzs.com; therefore if your browser is set to reject all cookies, the website will not function properly and you may lose functionality.  Specifically, we require our Members to have cookies enabled in order to accumulate and receive fundzs ( i.e. , cash payments).  We do not link cookies or web beacons to any Personal Information.   We may also enable advertisers and ad servers to promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on zuuzs.com. These advertisers and ad servers may use cookies and/or web beacons to monitor information related to served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of a third-party and the advertiser. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers.
2. #### B. Information Collected Automatically
We automatically receive and collect from your internet use information like your IP address, the URLs of websites from which you arrive or leave zuuzs.com, your type of browser and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us, your operating system, your mobile provider, your mobile device, and your ISP. We may use such information to analyze trends, administer the website, prevent fraud, track visitor movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information.
3. #### C. Website Activity Information
We keep track of some of the actions you take on zuuzs.com, such as participating on discussion boards/forums, providing ratings and reviews, inviting friends or indicating you “like” a post/product.

We may also collect information about you and your friends who use zuuzs.com, from any social network you may have connected from, in order to provide you with a more personalized experience.  We may establish programs with advertising partners and other websites in which they share information with us, such as, ask advertisers to tell us how our Members responded to the ads we showed them (and for comparison purposes, how other Members who didn’t see the ads acted on their website). This data sharing, commonly known as “conversion tracking,” helps us measure our advertising effectiveness and improve the quality of the advertisements you see. We may receive information about whether or not you’ve seen or interacted with certain ads on other websites in order to measure the effectiveness of those ads.  If in any of these cases we receive data that we do not already have, we will within 180 days, stop associating Personal Information received with any particular Member.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of ours or that acquirer’s assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
6. Disclosure of Anonymous Information to Trusted Third Parties By Us
We may share your Anonymous Information with third parties, but not in a manner that would reveal your identity. We may share your Personal Information, sometimes in conjunction with your Anonymous Information, with service providers that may be associated with us to perform functions on our behalf. For example, outsourced customer care agents or technology assistants may need access to your information to perform services for you. Your information will be treated as private and confidential by such service providers and not used for any other purpose than we authorize. In addition, from time to time, we may share Anonymous Information about our Member base with carefully selected third parties, so they can offer products and services that we believe may be of interest to our Members.
7. Disclosure to Trusted Third Parties at Your Request
While visiting zuuzs.com, we may provide you with advertisements, promotions, sweepstakes and offers from third party providers. If you choose to accept any such offers, you may either (depending on the situation) directly provide your information in connection with the offer to such third party provider, or we will provide your information, including billing information, to the third party provider by pre-populating the offer registration forms. Your information will not be transferred until you actually accept the offer. You may opt-out of the offer at any time up until your acceptance. Please refer to the third party provider’s own privacy policy (provided on the offer pages) if you have any questions regarding how your information is used by such providers. Please be aware that these offers may be presented on pages framed by zuuzs.com. Although these offer pages have the look and feel of zuuzs.com, you will be submitting your information directly to the third-party advertiser. You agree that we will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings, including the sharing of the information you supply to us with third party providers described here, or as the result of the presence of such providers on zuuzs.com.
8. Protection of zuuzs.com and Others
We release account and other Personal Information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of zuuzs.com, our Members, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing Personal Information from Members for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.
How We Keep Your Information Secure
The security of your Personal Information is important to zuuzs.com.  We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your Personal Information from unauthorized access and disclosure.  zuuzs.com uses a secure, encrypted connection (called an SSL connection) on all pages where you access or transmit Personal Information.  We want you to feel confident using zuuzs.com to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.   It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.  Members should also take care with how they handle and disclose their Personal Information and should avoid sending Personal Information through insecure email.
Your Privacy With zuuzs.com
zuuzs.com will never ask for your username, password or any other Personal Information in an unsolicited phone call, email or letter. Further, any contact with zuuzs.com customer service in which Personal Information is exchanged with a customer service representative will be used only for the purpose of satisfying your request. Any Personal Information you provide will not be recorded or used for any reason beyond that of the stated request.
If you choose to use our referral program to tell a friend about zuuzs.com, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend an email inviting him or her to visit zuuzs.com. zuuzs.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this email and tracking the success of our referral program.
