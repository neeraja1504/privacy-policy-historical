Any other ZINGFIT products and services offered through any other venues, websites and mobile applications that direct you to this Privacy Policy.
Collectively the “ZINGFIT Services”.

Other ZINGFIT Services related data (e.g., customer requests, statistics, gender, weight, FTP score, etc.).
3. How We Collect Information
Through the ZINGFIT Services
We collect information about you whenever you use the ZINGFIT Services, for example:
If you are a Client Studio, when you sign up for our ZINGFIT System, we ask for your company name, address, phone number, email, credit card information, tax identification number, and other information about your business, as well as names and email addresses of authorized individuals on your account. We also collect Personal Information about your customers that they provide to the ZINGFIT Services when they initiate a transaction or otherwise interact with you, such as to book a class or make a purchase. If you attend one of our events (e.g., a tradeshow, webinar, or training), we may ask for your feedback, contact details or other information to follow-up with you, such as send you marketing communications consistent with your choices.
If you are an End User, we collect information about you when you interact with the ZINGFIT Services. For example, if you initiate a transaction through the ZINGFIT Service, such as a purchase, we may collect your Personal Information as well as any other information you provide in order to process the transaction. This information may be shared with third parties solely for the purposes of processing such transactions on your behalf. We encrypt credit card numbers using industry standard technology. We may also collect other Personal Information at the request of the Client Studio you are transacting with or through. We may also store information that your computer or mobile device provides to us in connection with your use of the ZINGFIT Services, such as IP address.
From other sources:
In addition to the information we collect from you through ZINGFIT Services, we may receive information about you from other sources, such as public databases, strategic and joint marketing partners, social media pages and platforms, people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms, as well as from other third parties. For example, if you elect to connect your social media account to your ZINGFIT App account, certain information from your social media account may be shared with us, including information that’s part of your profile or your friends’ profiles. We may also collect other Personal Information through the ZINGFIT Services under the direction of our Client Studios.
We need to collect Personal Information in order to provide the requested ZINGFIT Service to you. If you do not provide or enable us to collect the necessary information, we may not be able to provide the ZINGFIT Service. If you disclose any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the ZINGFIT Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

5. How Personal Information May Be Disclosed
We may disclose your Personal Information:
To our affiliates for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. ZINGFIT LLC is the party responsible for the management of the jointly-used Personal Information.
In connection with processing transactions for your benefit via the zingfit System, to our strategic partners and third-party service providers — who provide services such as website hosting, data analysis, payment processing services, order fulfillment, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, email delivery, credit card processing, auditing and other similar services.
To our Client Studios if you are an End User and are using our ZINGFIT Services to interact with that Client Studio. Please contact the Client Studio you interact with directly for more information on that Client Studio’s privacy practices.
To you, through message boards, chat, profile pages and blogs and other services to which you are able to post information and materials, including as described in the sections below titled “Testimonials, Ratings and Reviews” and “Public Forum.”
To your friends associated with your social media account, to other website users and as well as to your social media account provider, in connection with your social sharing activity, such as if you connect your Facebook account to your ZINGFIT Services.
To business partners in the context of a corporate transaction. If ZINGFIT is involved in a sale or business transaction (e.g., merger or acquisition), ZINGFIT will retain a legitimate interest in disclosing or transferring your Personal Information to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock
(including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). Such third parties may include, for example, an acquiring or target entity and its advisors.
To public authorities in response to lawful requests, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Please note that we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use it for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information. In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information. If we combine any Other Information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.
6. How to access, correct, delete or exercise other rights regarding your Personal Information
Where applicable law allows for such a request, if you would like to request to access, correct, object to the use, restrict or delete Personal Information that you have previously provided to us, or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law), you may contact ZINGFIT at privacy@zingfit.com with the subject line “Data Subject Request.” We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.
For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Moreover, where you are an End User, ZINGFIT may need to forward your request and refer you to your Client Studio who may be better placed to address your request.
Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the Personal Information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion). There may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed.
If you are under 18 years of age and a user of the ZINGFIT Services, you may also be entitled to ask us to remove content or information that you have posted to the ZINGFIT Service by submitting a request to support@zingfit.com. Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information.
If you are a customer of one of our Client Studios and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Client Studios, or would like request the exercise of a right as set out above in relation to Personal Information held by a Client Studio, please contact the Client Studio directly.

Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

You can log in to some of the ZINGFIT Services using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form.

This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for the privacy information or other practices of any third parties, including our Client Studios and any third party operating any Third Party Offering, site or other products and services used in connection with the ZINGFIT Services. The inclusion of a link does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates.

15. Data Retention
Subject to your right to request the removal of your Personal Information as set forth in Paragraph 6, we will retain your Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:
The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the ZINGFIT Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the ZINGFIT Services);
Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
16. Security of Your Information
The security of Personal Information is a high priority at ZINGFIT. We seek to use reasonable technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect Personal Information within our organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
