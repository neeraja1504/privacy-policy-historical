In some cases, these Other Sites may have the same (or a similar) look and feel as our Site and therefore may appear to be part of our Site. However, whenever you choose to access Other Sites or non-Ziggs content via the Ziggs Site, a separate browser window will launch and you will leave the Ziggs Site. Ziggs is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of Other web sites to which you choose to link from the Site. Ziggs encourages you to review the privacy policies of those other web sites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.

In other areas, Ziggs collects or may collect demographic information that is not unique to you such as your postal code, age, preferences, gender, interests and favorites (“Demographic Information”). Sometimes Ziggs collects or may collect a combination of the two types of information. Ziggs also gathers or may gather certain information about your use of our Site (such as what areas you visit and what services you access) and information about your computer hardware and software, including without limitation your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring web site addresses (“Usage Information” and together with Demographic Information, “Non-Personal Information”). The Personal Information and Non-Personal Information we collect and/or that you voluntarily provide on the Site will be referred to in this Privacy Statement collectively as “Information.”
