We may use how you browse in order to show you ads for Zirtual or Zirtual partners that are relevant to your interests and individual needs. We may use cookies and other information to provide relevant interest-based advertising to you. Interest-based ads are ads presented to you based on your browsing behavior in order to provide you with ads more tailored to your interests. These interest-based ads may be presented to you while you are browsing our site or third-party sites not owned by Zirtual.
We belong to ad networks that may use your browsing history across participating websites to show you interest-based advertisements on those websites. You can opt-out of receiving interest-based ads from us by changing the settings on your browsers or by visiting Google's Ads Settings at www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads.
