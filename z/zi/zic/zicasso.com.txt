Trip Requests and Trip Plans
The Site is a business-to-consumer travel site that facilitates relationships between travel companies ("Travel Companies") and potential consumers who want to purchase travel services ("Travelers"). A Traveler submits information to the Site about travel services that the Traveler is interested in purchasing (each, a "Trip Request"), to which a Travel Company can submit a proposal to such Traveler ("Trip Plan"). Other Site users can see the content of a Trip Request, however, only Travel Companies can see the username of the Traveler associated with such Trip Request.
Profile Pages, Photos, Message Boards, Feedback, Ratings, Comments, and Public Forums
As part of your account, you may create a profile page and upload photos and post travel logs. Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose online (in feedback, ratings and comments, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others.
Your username (not your email address) is displayed on the Site to other Site users when you upload photos, post feedback and/or comments or send messages through this Site. Therefore, if you associate your name with your username, then Site users to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify you through your activities on the Site.
Data Integrity
Zicasso processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. To the extent necessary for such purposes, we review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our Services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.
Cookies
We may use small text files called cookies to improve overall Site experience. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you.
Aggregate Information
The Site may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, browser type, IP addresses, External Web Sites (defined below) linked to, and we may analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
Disclosure
We may provide your personally identifiable information and the data generated by cookies and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us in providing our Services to you. For example, we may provide your personally identifiable information to a Travel Company in order to assist them to submit a Trip Plan in response to your Trip Request. We will also disclose your personally identifiable information (a) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or otherwise in cooperation with an investigation of a governmental authority, (b) to enforce the Zicasso Terms of Use agreement or to protect our rights or (c) to protect the safety of users of our Site and our Services. We will not sell your personally identifiable information to any company or organization except we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Zicasso participates or to a purchaser or acquirer of all or substantially all of Zicasso's assets to which this Site relates.

Security

Zicasso may use firewall protection, password protection, internal restrictions on who in Zicasso has access to your personally identifiable information and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information.
Updating, Correcting and Deleting Personally Identifiable Information
Zicasso provides you with the ability to review, correct and update your personally identifiable information that you provide to us by accessing and modifying this information on your profile page or by submitting a request to us by e-mail to: [emailÂ protected].

Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your personal data will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create a user account with the Site as a visitor from outside the United States, by using the Site you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in the European Union or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy.
