How We Collect Information
Browser Cookies and Pixel Tags
A browser cookie (“Cookie”) is a small piece of information stored by a web browser that is used to communicate with a web server when the browser connects to a web site. A browser Cookie is persistent, which means that once it is placed in your web browser, it will stay there until it is deleted.
In addition to Cookies, we or third party advertisers may also utilize “Pixel Tags” (also know as “1×1 gifs,” “clear gifs,” or “web beacons.”)
We might utilize one or more Cookies or Pixel Tags in order to enhance and tailor your experience with ZipList.
Ways in which we may use Cookies and Pixel Tags
To store user login information and your preferences. Perhaps the simplest way we might use a Cookie is to make your ZipList experience more efficient by saving your login and preference information.
To acquire information about your web browser in order to modify or improve your browsing experience with ZipList. This information is stored in our web server logs (more information below on how we use web server logs) and helps provide us with information regarding how you and other Users are utilizing ZipList.
To understand activity within any given session of Use. We may use Session Cookies to gather information regarding when and how long you use ZipList in any given session. Session Cookies are not persistent – that is to say they are not stored in your web browser – they are deleted as soon as you close your browser.
To provide you with personalized content or other information. Based on both personal and aggregate information, we may use a browser Cookie to dynamically select from a variety of dynamic or updated content or information.
We do not store any personal information in the Cookie, but we may link information in the Cookie to your Account Information. If we choose to do so, our use of the Cookie will be governed by the terms and conditions in this Privacy Policy.
To Assist in Targeted Advertising. We may use information stored in the Cookie to determine which advertisements may be displayed to you by ZipList. Additionally, advertisements displayed to you may be served directly from third parties, and these third parties may place their own Cookies in your browser. This allows them, among other things, to recognize which advertisements are viewed and clicked.
We or other third parties may use Pixel Tags personalize advertisements, track activity and gain a better understand of the effectiveness of these ads. Beyond the use of Pixel Tags on the ZipList Service, Pixel Tags may also be placed in email messages sent from us or by third parties on our behalf.
We do not have the ability to access or control Cookies or Pixel Tags that may be used by third party advertisers. Accordingly, our Privacy Policy only covers Cookies or Pixel Tags used by ZipList and is does not encompass the use of these or other tracking methods utilized by any of its advertisers.
You may choose to block browser Cookies
Although most web browsers are by default set to accept Cookies, you do not have to accept Cookies. At any time you can exclude them from being stored in your browser by configuring it to reject Cookies (some browsers may also allow you to be notified to selectively accept or reject Cookies on a case-by-case basis). Each web browser has a different method in which to configure its Cookie policy, so refer to the help information provided by each browser developer on how to configure it. However, if you block Cookies from ZipList, you may be prevented from signing on to ZipList or certain features or capabilities may not work properly.

We may use this information to change or modify ZipList, to assess or monitor the Service’s performance or utilization, to gather and analyze trend information and to collect demographic information.
