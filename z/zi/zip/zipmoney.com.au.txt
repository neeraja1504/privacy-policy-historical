Apart from the purposes above we do not give your information to any other person or company outside our related company group.

If you do not provide your driver licence or passport number or your document is not verified by the Document Verification Service, we may not be satisfied as to your identity and you may not be able to open an account with us online
Website Traffic Information
Because of the way that World Wide Web communication standards work, when you arrive at or leave the ZIP Websites, we automatically receive the Web address of the site that you came from or are going to. We also collect information on which pages of our website you visit while you are on the ZIP Websites, the type of browser you use and the times you access our websites. We use this information to try to understand our customers’ preferences better and to manage the load on our servers, so as to improve our service and your experience with ZIP.
Our Use of “Cookies”
“Cookies” are small files of data that reside on your computer and allow us to recognise you as a ZIP customer if you return to the ZIP site using the same computer and browser or otherwise use the ZIP Services. We send a “session cookie” to your computer if and when you log in to your ZIP account by entering your email address and password. We use these cookies to recognise you if you visit multiple pages in our site during the same session, so that you don’t need to re­enter your password multiple times. Once you log out or close your browser, these session cookies expire and no longer have any effect.
We also use longer­ lasting cookies to display your email address on our sign­in form so you don’t have to retype the email address each time you log in to your ZIP account or otherwise use the ZIP Services. Our cookie files are encoded so that your email address and other information can only be interpreted by ZIP. We may, however, share cookie information with certain merchants with whom we have an official co­marketing relationship regarding whether a user identified by the merchant is already registered with ZIP.
We and our service providers also use cookies to customise our services, content and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. You may encounter cookies from third parties when using the ZIP Services on websites we do not control. For example, if you view a web page created by a third party or use an application developed by a third party, there may be a cookie placed by that web page or application.
Storing and retaining personal information
We store personal information in electronic or hardcopy form (or both) and use industry standard levels of security to prevent unauthorised access.
Personal information is only accessible to our staff or to authorised service providers with incidental access to supply their services to us.
We do not retain any of your information longer than is required for the business relationship with you or for legal purposes. When we are informed, we will keep the personal information we hold accurate, complete and up to date.
Zip does not disclose personal information to overseas recipients.
Sensitive Information
ZIP does not collect sensitive information (for example: political or religious beliefs, ethnic background or sexual preferences) about you.
Anonymity
Where it is lawful and practicable ZIP endeavours to de­identify information collected about you.
Identifiers
ZIP does not use identifiers assigned by the Commonwealth Government agencies (for example:
tax file number) to identify any individual.
Marketing
We may use your personal information from time to time to inform you about our current and
future products and services including contacting you by telephone, email, SMS or post. You can request that you do not receive direct marketing communications by contacting us directly by telephone on (02) 8294 2345 or by email at customercare@zip.co or by simply clicking “unsubscribe” or “STOP” to any emails or SMS offers or electronic marketing you may receive.
Access and Correction
We invite you to update and keep current any personal information you think we may hold about you. To do this, or to simply find out what personal information we currently hold, please contact us at the address below.
If you wish to access the personal information we hold about you, we may charge a small fee to cover our costs of supplying that information. We will inform you of this cost at the time you make a request.
If you believe any personal information held by us is inaccurate or out of date you will be given the opportunity to update that personal information.
Queries and complaints
We are committed to the Australian Privacy Principles for handling personal information and so, if you have any query or complaint in relation to the way in which we collect, use or disclose personal information, please contact us. We will use our best efforts to respond to your query or request as quickly as reasonably possible.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Policy does not apply to ZIP’s employee records.
