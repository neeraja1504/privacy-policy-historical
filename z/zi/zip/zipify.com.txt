Smart Marketer Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) of Mensch Products, LLC doing business as Smart Marketer (“Smart Marketer,” “we,” “us” or “our”) governs how we handle the personal information we collect for our own purposes via Smart Marketer websites, mobile applications, agreements and our social media assets (collectively, “our sites”), and by email in connection with our business development eﬀorts, marketing programs, surveys, oﬀers, events and other promotions. We may obtain this information directly from you as well as from our aﬀiliated companies, business partners and other third parties.
Information We Collect
The types of information we may obtain about you include:
Personal or business contact information (such as name, address and email address, social media, name of your company or department, and your business function or title);
Demographic information (such as age and gender);
A general geographic location (such as country and city) from which a visitor accesses our sites;
Information you provide by interacting with us through our sites, including by submitting questions, commenting on our forums and interacting with us through social media;
Contact information of individuals with whom you would like to share our content;
Payment information (such as account or credit card number for processing through our third party payment processor); and
Other details that you may submit to us or that may be included in the information provided to us by third parties.
The information we may collect automatically includes:
Usage information. Whenever you visit or interact with our sites, we, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how our sites are accessed and used (“Usage information”). Usage information may include browser type, device type, operating system, application version, the page served, the time, the preceding page views, and your use of features or applications on our sites, as well as search terms that visitors use to reach our sites. This information helps us keep our sites usable for our visitors and allows us to tailor content to a visitor’s interests.
Device Identifier. We automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for the Device (computer, mobile phone, tablet or other device) you use to access our sites. A Device Identifier is a number that is assigned to your Device when you access a website or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. We may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer our sites, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, track users’ web page movements, help identify you and your interests, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
Cookies; Pixel Tags. The technologies used on our sites to collect Usage information, including Device Identifiers, include but are not limited to: cookies (data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit our sites), mobile analytics software and pixel tags (transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed). Cookies may also be used to associate you with social networking sites like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google+, Twitter and, if you so choose, enable interaction between your activities on our sites and your activities on such social networking sites. We, or our partners, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation, to perform analytics, and personalize your experience while visiting our sites (such as allowing us to select which ads or offers are most likely to appeal to you, based on your interests, preferences, location or demographic information). A pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server.
To learn how you may be able to reduce the number of cookies you receive from us, or delete cookies that have already been installed in your browser’s cookie folder, or prevent tracking activities, please refer to your browser’s tools or help menu or other instructions related to your browser. Because an industry-standard Do-Not-Track protocol has not yet been established, our information collection practices on our sites will continue to operate as described in this online privacy policy regardless of any “Do Not Track” signals that may be sent by certain browsers. However, you may refuse to accept cookies in order to prevent tracking activities. If you disable or opt out of receiving cookies, please be aware that some features and services on our sites may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your account. In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests. We may use third-party website analytics tools that collect automated information about visitor traﬀic on our sites, such as Google Analytics. You can learn how Google collects and processes data by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.

We may combine the information we collect with publicly available information and information we receive from our aﬀiliated companies, business partners and other third parties. We may use that combined information for the purposes described in this Policy. On our sites, we may collect information about your online activities to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. You may see certain ads on our sites and other sites because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our advertising to users through demographic, behavioral and contextual means. These networks may track your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services, including by collecting information through automated means through the use of cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other methods. These networks may place cookies, web beacons or similar tracking devices while you are visiting our sites or other sites. The networks use this information to show you advertisements for Smart Marketer and our business partners that are tailored to your individual interests. They may also use the information they collect for their own purposes. The information our ad network vendors collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the vendors’ advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you have viewed, and the actions you take on the sites. This data collection and ad targeting take place both on our sites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the eﬀectiveness of our marketing eﬀorts.
