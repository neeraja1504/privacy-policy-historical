This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Zipscene LLC, an Ohio limited liability company, (“Zipscene”, “us”, “we” or “our”) collects, protects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users of www.zipscene.com, www.cafezipscene.com (the “Sites”) and any website that we maintain on behalf of our clients (the “Client Sites”). This privacy policy applies to our Sites and our Client Sites and all products and services offered by Zipscene, and describes how we use, share and protect the information that we collect.
Information is at the core of Zipscene’s business. Our programs involve various uses of information, including the storage, exchange, transfer, management, analysis and reporting of such information.  We create engaging digital marketing programs for our clients.  We also collect and use information we and our Clients gather through the Sites and the Client Sites, as well as our Clients’ retail operations to create and facilitate the delivery of ads, promotions and offers tailored to the preferences of the users of the Sites and the Client Sites.  To do this, we gather information  regarding our clients’ customers’ use of the Client Sites and other online and in-store services to create customer profiles, allowing us and our clients to use what is learned to deliver custom content and offers to their customers. We also obtain marketing information (including information about customers) from third parties and may combine all of this information to make it more complete, accurate and useful.

How We Use The Information We Collect
We use the information we collect about you to administer our Sites and our Client Sites and to  provide you with the information, services or products that you request. We combine the data that we receive from our clients’ customers with other sources to create customer profiles. We use profile data to improve the customer experience by providing you with custom marketing messages and offers on behalf of our clients.  We also share such aggregated and de-individualized profile data with third parties (in a form that will not allow you to be identified) for market research and other purposes.
To Whom We May Disclose The Information We Collect
We take reasonable precautions to be sure that nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates to whom we disclose your personally identifiable information are aware of our privacy policy and will treat the information in a similarly responsible manner. Our contracts and written agreements with nonaffiliated third parties that receive information from us about you prevent further transfer of the information.  We will not disclose your personal information to third parties except to provide you with the product or service you request, or under the circumstances described in this policy.
Agents & Contractors. We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business and the Sites and the Client Sites or to administer activities on our behalf. Our contractors sometimes have access to your personal information in the course of assisting in operating our business and providing products or services to you. These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services, and/or content for the operation and maintenance of our site. Contractors have an obligation under their contracts with us to keep your information confidential and to comply with our privacy and security policies.
Marketing Purposes.  We share aggregated and de-individualized data with third parties (in a form that will not allow you to be identified) for market research and other purposes.  We may also share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes, provided that you have opted-in to receive such offers or messages.
Aggregated non-personal information. We may share aggregated non-personal information about you and de-identified individual data and profiles with third parties. This is information that is combined with the non-personal information of other users and does not allow you to be identified or contacted. Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for this aggregated information. We also may not limit the third parties’ use of the aggregated information or de-identified individual data.
Changes in our Company Structure. We may choose to sell all or a portion of our assets. In such a transaction, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if Zipscene, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Zipscene goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information could be transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and you consent that any acquirer of Zipscene may continue to use your personal and non-personal information pursuant to the terms set forth in this policy.
Disclosure for Legal Reasons. We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that it is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Zipscene, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information on our Sites or our Client Sites from those we know are under age 13, and no part of our Sites is structured to attract anyone under 13.  If the parent or guardian of a child under 13 believes that the child has provided us with any information through any of the Sites or the Client Sites, the parent or guardian of that child should contact us if they want this information deleted from our files. If we obtain knowledge from any source that Zipscene has information about a child under 13 in retrievable form in its files, we will delete that information from our existing files.
