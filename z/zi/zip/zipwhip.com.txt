Security of Your Personal information.  Your security matters to us. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures designed to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
Information from Children.  From time to time as part of a special Zipwhip promotion, such as “texting to Santa,” we may request information from children under 13 years of age. We will take all necessary steps to protect the privacy and safety of any child participating in these activities in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
Obtaining Verifiable Parental Consent.  We will use reasonable effort to obtain verifiable parental consent prior to the collection and use of personally identifiable information from children under 13. The method of parental consent verification may vary according to the event in which the child wishes to participate. Means of obtaining such consent may include, but are not limited to, offline consent such as printing and submitting a permission form by mail or fax or online consent that contains information that enables Zipwhip to verify the identity of the parent.
Parental Review.  Zipwhip will allow parents to review any personal information collected from their children, based on verifying the identity of the consenting parent. Parents may revoke their consent and delete information collected from their children at their discretion. In such event, Zipwhip will then stop collecting, using, or disclosing information from that child, and will end that child’s participation in that event.
When Parental Consent is not Required.  We do not require parental consent in order to collect and use information texted to Zipwhip to:
Respond more than once directly to a specific request from a child and not used to re-contact the child beyond the scope of the child’s request (e.g. a response to a child’s text to Santa);
Request the name or online contact information of a parent for the sole purpose of obtaining a verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification; or
Respond directly to a child’s request on a one-time basis to a specific request where the information is not used for purposes other than the event (e.g. Santa’s response to a child’s text request).
Texts received from children under the age of 13 will not be used for any purpose unrelated to a particular event; each will only be stored long enough to complete the event and will be promptly deleted thereafter from Zipwhip databases.

When changes are made, the Company will make a new copy of the Privacy Policy available at the Site.  Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of the changes on our Site.  These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Service.  If you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your personal information, you must notify us prior to the effective date of the changes that you wish to deactivate your Account with us.  Continued use of our Site, Application or Service, following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.
