What does this privacy policy cover?
This Privacy Policy covers ZipDial’s treatment of your personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that ZipDial gathers when you are accessing ZipDial’s web site or when you use ZipDial’s services. The types of Personal Information collected may include your full name, address, e-mail address, phone or other communication device number and other data related to your account (including contact lists and preferences).

What Personal Information does ZipDial collect?
The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our users.
Personal Information you provide to us.
We may receive and store any information you enter on our web site or in connection with our services or that you provide to us in any other way. It is important to note that we only store Personal Information provided to use ZipDial services. For example, if you link your mobile number to your Twitter account through ZipDial, we do not store your Twitter password; it is only used by Twitter to authorize a one-time linkage with ZipDial. The Personal Information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain services, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about the services and anything else that you might opt-in for.
Personal Information collected automatically.
We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our web site or services. ZipDial may choose to automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. ZipDial may also choose to automatically collect information from your use of the services, including account activity (e.g. storage use, number of log-ins, number of calls, phone numbers dialed), data displayed and clicked on, and other usage information (e.g. the identity of your mobile operator, your mobile subscriber circle, subscription and response data while using ZipDial services). This type of data allows us to improve and personalize our services and content delivered to you. ZipDial will not share any of your Personal Information including mobile number, individual profile information, individual usage data or any data generated while linking third party services through ZipDial, with any third party, business partner or customer of ZipDial that did not previously store such information, except as described below. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate, not individual specific, information to our partners about how our users and customers, collectively, use our site and mobile services and about the collective responses and opinions of our users and customers as expressed through use of our services.
Communications
We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail or text message if your computer or phone or other communication device supports this type of program. We may also compare our user and/or customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users. If you have subscribed to any ZipDial mobile services, ZipDial will provide you a toll free number to dial in and OPT OUT of the service. You may dial that number at any time if you wish to discontinue receiving SMS communications for a particular ZipDial service.. ZipDial fully supports and complies with TRAI regulations regarding SMS services, notifying customers at least every 6 months of how they may opt out of an SMS alerts service.

ZipDial cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or to identify your screen name or e-mail address. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of
ways.
