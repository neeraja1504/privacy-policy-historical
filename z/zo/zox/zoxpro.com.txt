Website visit information
The website makes a record of the user's visits and logs anonymous information for statistical purposes, such as the IP address of the user's computer, the top-level domain name of the user (such as .com or .au), the data and time of the user's visit, what pages on the site were accessed, what search terms were used, etc. This information is only collected for statistical and debugging purposes; that is, the information is only used in order to make the web site function better.
No attempt will be made to identify the user except in the very unlikely event that an investigation is necessary, where a law enforcement agency alone would have the power to inspect the records of the Internet Service Provider to obtain this information.
Cookies
‘Cookies’ are small pieces of text data that a web server can store on, and later retrieve from, a user's computer. They do not personally identify you, but do identify your browser. Cookies can be either ‘persistent’ or ‘session’ based. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer, contain an expiration date, and may be used to track your browsing behaviour upon return to the issuing web site. Session cookies are short-lived, are used only during a browsing session, and expire when you shut down your browser.
The ZOXPRO.COM website uses persistent cookies. They record your preferences in relation to your use of the site and provide us with other information about your enquiry that allows us to recognise your browser if you return to the ZOXPRO.COM website in the future. This enables the ZOXPRO.COM to present information that may be most relevant to you based on your previous visits. They also assist the ZOXPRO.COM to understand what parts of the site users find the most useful and improve the effectiveness of the website.
The cookies on the ZOXPRO.COM site do not read the information on your hard drive. They do not make your computer perform any actions or make your computer send information to any other computer via the internet. The ZOXPRO.COM makes no attempt to associate cookies with users' names or identities. Our server cannot find out your name or email address, or anything about your computer, by using cookies.
Managing cookies on your computer
Most browsers are set by default to accept cookies; however you can configure your computer to determine how you would prefer to interact with cookies across the internet. You may wish to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to allow each cookie on to your hard drive, or to block cookies altogether. However, if you decide to not accept cookies set by this web site, some of the ZOXPRO.COM web pages may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access ZOXPro.comin information.
You may also set your browser so that the cookies set by this web site are destroyed when your browser shuts down and no personal information is maintained which might identify you should you visit our web site at a later date. In this way, the persistent cookies set by this web site will effectively function as session cookies.
There are several techniques available for managing cookies in various browsers. Please see the help section of your browser. More information on cookies and internet privacy can be found on the  Federal Privacy Commissioner’s website. [ http://www.privacy.gov.au/internet/internet_privacy/ ]
Web beacons or pixel tags
The ZOXPRO.COM, or a third party engaged by the ZOXPRO.COM, may use web beacons on some pages on this website. A web beacon (also known as a web bug, pixel tag or clear GIF) is a graphic image (usually transparent and 1 pixel x 1 pixel in size) placed on a web page which is used to better understand the usage patterns of visitors to the page.
When the HTML code for the web beacon points to a site to retrieve the image, at the same time it can pass along information such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the web beacon was viewed and for how long, the type of browser that retrieved the image and previously set cookie values. Web beacons do not give any extra information away.
Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies and are usually used to assess the effectiveness of particular promotional campaigns. This enables the ZOXPRO.COM to improve future online campaigns. Reconfiguring the browser's cookie settings, as discussed above, can prevent web beacons from tracking the user's activity. The web beacon may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address, but unique information will not be recorded.
Security
There are risks associated with the transmission of information over the internet and you should therefore make your own assessment of the risks in the provision of your information to ZOXPRO.COM internet sites.
In the secure transaction facilities available through the ZOXPRO.COM website, your information is encrypted as it travels between your computer and our servers. Encryption makes it difficult for others to view your information. These facilities use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. SSL is an industry standard for secure e-commerce transactions. If your browser did not support SSL, you would not be able to access these services.
The ZOXPRO.COM also monitors developments in security and encryption technologies and reviews and updates its processes and procedures in line with industry standards.
