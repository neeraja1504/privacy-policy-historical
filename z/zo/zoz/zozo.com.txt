What you can do to better protect yourself on the Internet
Know the risks.
When you communicate with others online, you should be aware that, when disclosing personal information such as one's actual name, member name, e-mail address, etc., on a web page, in a newsgroup, chat room or forum, that information may be collected and used by others to send that person unsolicited e-mail from other parties, outside the MHS Network. Some of the e-mail you receive may be useful to you, but some may not.
Educate yourself.
Search the Web for as much information as you can about how to protect your privacy. Look for a privacy statement in the sites you visit. A good place to start is TRUSTe -- an independent, non-profit privacy initiative dedicated to building users' trust and confidence in the Internet. Please visit the Federal Trade Commissionâ€™s web site and read information on being a Savvy Internet Traveler and other privacy initiatives.

Tell your children: "Never talk to strangers!"
While the MHS Network works hard to protect children on its sites, MHS cannot protect their privacy once they leave. Please teach children to not give out their names or other personal information to anyone on the Internet. They should also be instructed not to fill out any forms or register at any website without your knowledge and consent. Take advantage of the online resources for parents available on the MHS Network, such as SearchGuard and GetNetWise.
