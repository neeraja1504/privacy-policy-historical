Your Privacy & Security
We know that your privacy is important and we are committed to your protection while you visit our website. We do not sell, rent, exchange or distribute your name, e-mail address or any other information to any third party.
To process your order, we must have several pieces of information to process your order. Your email address and phone number are used in case we need to notify you about your order, and you will also receive an email when your order is shipped. We do not use your personal information in any other way.
We use SSL encryption when accepting your credit card information during our online checkout process. In addition, we use the same encryption when transferring your credit card information to our internal fulfillment system. Your information is not accessible to anyone from the internet. To further enhance your security, we delete all credit card information from our database within 24 hours of receipt.
Because we believe the security of your credit card information to be of the utmost importance, we do not offer a non-SSL encrypted version of our order form. If you disable your internet browser's SSL compatibility feature, you will not be able to use our on-line shopping. However, you may still order via phone (1-800-878-4764) or fax (770-664-4557) or mail (Zoogster Costumes, PO Box 2730, Alpharetta, GA 30023).
