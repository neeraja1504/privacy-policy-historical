(b) information about any transactions carried out between you and us on or in relation to this website, including information relating to any purchases you make of our goods or services;
(c) information that you provide to us for the purpose of requesting information, registering with us and/or subscribing to our website services and/or email notifications.
Our website is not directed to children under thirteen (13) years or age and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
(2) Information about website visits
We may collect information about your computer and your visits to this website such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and number of page views. We may use this information in the administration of this website, to improve the website’s usability, and for marketing purposes.
We use cookies on this website. A cookie is a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.
We may send a cookie which may be stored on by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. We may use the information we obtain from the cookie in the administration of this website, to improve the website’s usability and for marketing purposes. We may also use that information to recognize your computer when you visit our website, and to personalize our website for you. Our advertisers may also send you cookies.
Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector.) This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.
(3) Using your personal data
Personal data submitted on this website will be used for the purposes specified in this privacy policy or in relevant parts of the website.
In addition to the uses identified elsewhere in this privacy policy, we may use your personal information to:
(a) improve your browsing experience by personalizing the website;
(b) respond to your comments, requests or inquiries;
(c) send information (other than marketing communications) to you which we think may be of interest to you by post or by email or similar technology;
(d) send to you marketing communications relating to our business or the businesses of carefully-selected third parties which we think may be of interest to you by post or, where you have specifically agreed to this, by email or similar technology.
(e) provide other companies with statistical information about our users.
We do not receive or store credit card information from registered users. We use an outside credit card processing company to bill you for services. The unaffiliated credit card processing company does not retain, share, store or use your personally identifiable information for any other purposes, however, we cannot guarantee that there won’t be a security breach of the outside credit card processing company.
We may obtain your written consent from time to time in electronic form by using online agreements or other acknowledgements through our application, including for any other contemplated uses of your personal data not addressed in this privacy policy. Please read all online agreements carefully before accepting them.
We use the contact information provided by an entity to communicate with individuals working on behalf of such entity.  Therefore, you may receive a communication from us in response to a request by your employer or the manager of an account to add you as a registered user.
(4) Products and Clients
Rigor is the maker of the Rigor application, an application testing and monitoring suite. Rigor sells and distributes the Rigor application to third party clients who may use it to test and monitor their own applications, including those applications hosted and managed by third parties. While Rigor sells only to ethical clients, it cannot be held responsible if its clients engage in unethical use of the information gathered by or functionality contained within the Rigor application.
