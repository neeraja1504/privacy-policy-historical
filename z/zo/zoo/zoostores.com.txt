We also log certain non-personal information when you visit Zoostores.com, such as the type of browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) used, the type of operating system (e.g., Windows XP, Mac OSX) used, and the domain of your Internet service provider (e.g., Earthlink, AOL, MSN). We log this information using 'cookies,' which are small data text files that Web sites store on your computer's hard drive if your Web browser permits. Cookies, which can later be retrieved to identify you to Zoostores.com, make your use of our site easier, allow you to retrieve earlier shopping carts, and help us to maintain a secure site.

We only use or disclose to third parties the information you provide about yourself to fulfill an order, to enroll you in services you have requested, to respond to your inquiries, to request your feedback/review of your order experience or product, or to offer you related products or services.

We may disclose the personal information you provide in response to a particular legal process (e.g., court order, subpoena, law enforcement agency's request).
We require that Agents and Partners of Zoostores.com who have access to your personal information protect this information according to their stated Privacy Policies – or, in the event these Agents and Partners of Zoostores.com have no stated Privacy Policy, according to this Privacy Notice.
