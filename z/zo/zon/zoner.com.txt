Privacy Policy
Privacy And Personal Data Protection Policy of ZONER, Inc. ("ZONER")
This policy applies for the web pages in the ZONER domain, registered to and administered by ZONER. ZONER is not responsible for the behavior of operators of web pages that have the same name or domain, but which are not registered to ZONER.
ZONER, considers all of the personal and other data it obtains to be strictly confidential. When processing this data, it abides by the relevant data-privacy law of the nation where it is headquartered—Czech Act no. 101/2000 Coll., on the Protection of Personal Data, in accord with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (the General Data Protection Regulation).
Every user has the right to be informed as to what data about them ZONER keeps on record and is entitled to change this data and/or to state in writing that they do not consent to its processing. Every user can also request the immediate erasure of all their personal data. Keep in mind, however, that this means losing the ability to easily keep up to date on news, tutorials and special discounts for long-term customers. When sending an erasure request, contact admin@zoner.com. Note that the law requires us to store certain information on purchases made, and thus we must store this particular information.
Automatically Collected Data Related to ZONER Webpage Visits
This type of data does not include personal data regarding the page visitor. Instead, it includes data identifying his or her internet address and geographical region (IP address), time and date of the visit, length of time spent on the ZONER pages, list of subpages visited within the ZONER pages, list of pages/phrases/files searched for on the ZONER pages, web browser used, operating system used, and monitor settings used. The data obtained is used for optimizing ZONER’s web presence.
Personal Data Provided by Visitor to ZONER Web Pages
“Personal data” below means data relating to a particular person, that is, a person who can be identified directly or indirectly. ZONER acquires only such data as must be available in order to perform the activities listed in this Policy.
Who May Access Personal Data; Personal Data Security
ZONER takes due care to ensure that the types of data mentioned in this Policy are available only to those employees of ZONER who must have access to it for activities (e.g. support) to the benefit of the person who provided the data to ZONER or to whom the data otherwise relates. “Employee” above means any employee of ZONER, its subsidiaries or branches. ZONER will never provide personal data to third parties without the awareness and agreement of the person to whom said data relates.
Individual processes initiated on a ZONER web page may be continued on the pages of another company when this is essential for their continuation (e.g. completion of a product purchase process via an e-shop, particularly payments via credit card). In such cases, personal data may be shared between ZONER and the company performing such continuation of a process. ZONER takes care to ensure that its business partners treat personal data in a manner in accord with the law and moral principles, but it also recommends that, in cases where data will be shared with a ZONER business partner, the person sharing personal data also familiarizes himself or herself with the personal data policy available on the web page of the given business partner.
The personal data that ZONER acquires is stored on servers that are protected against unauthorized access. Sensitive portions of the ZONER web pages may also be protected via a password defined by the visitor, who takes full responsibility for his or her behavior as regards password security and secure access to such protected areas. Personal data relating to payment via credit card is encrypted using modern techniques that make it impossible for outside parties to steal or abuse it. ZONER cannot take responsibility for unauthorized access to personal data that occurs during data transfers made possible by security failures in non-ZONER software. Such data transfers may take place when data is being delivered outside the structure that is under the exclusive control of ZONER. Thus any person transferring personal data does so at their own risk.
Purposes for Which Personal Data Is Used
Personal data acquired by ZONER is used in connection with activities that lead to outcomes requested by the visitor to the ZONER web pages or achieved in connection with an agreement between ZONER and the visitor. Typical activities include:
completing orders initiated by the customer via the ZONER web pages
completing credit card payments via the secure web pages of ZONER or its e-commerce partner
participation in a ZONER contest or survey
product registration, for the purpose of offering further support or providing discounted, etc. product upgrades
communication with a copy of a ZONER product running on a user's computer for the purpose of automatic product updates that improve it or remove program errors
sending of informational materials (e.g. bulletins/newsletters) containing necessary information and interesting facts related to the visitor's object of interest
Other appropriate telephone, postal, or e-mail communication
Public Areas of the ZONER Web Pages
Public areas of the ZONER web pages can include for example forums and mailing lists for which the visitor signs up using forms on the ZONER web pages. It is the visitor's decision as to whether or not his or her personal data will be displayed in these public areas in the course of communication with other participants of said public areas.
Google Analytics
Zoner has access to Google Analytics, an ad-network-powered overview of visitors’ interests and demographics.
Our visitors can unsubscribe from the Google Analytics advertising network service. They can also personalize their ads within the Google ad network using their ad settings.
No action of any kind will be taken to join together personally identifying information with non-personally-identifying information previously acquired via advertising in the cookie-based Doubleclick network. The exception to this rule is when Zoner expressly states it will join these two information sets, and you, the user, provide agreement (active confirmation) in advance.
Changes to Personal Data in the ZONER Archives; Queries and Claims in Connection with Personal Data Protection
Every user may request a change to, or immediate deletion of, his or her record in the personal data database. Such requests should be sent to technical support (support@zoner.com). Any queries regarding personal data protection not answered above can also be answered by contacting technical support.
ZONER reserves the right to change this policy due to changes of legislation, changes to ZONER business policy, or other reasons. These changes will tend towards an increase in the protection of personal data.
This Privacy Policy was originally prepared in the English language. Although ZONER may provide one or more translations for your convenience, the English version will control in the case of any conflict or discrepancy.
