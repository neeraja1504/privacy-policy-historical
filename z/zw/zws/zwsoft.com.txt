The legal Basis for Processing the Data
We will process your Personal Data according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is a legal framework for the standardization of data protection within the EU.

Transmit Data to Areas outside the EU or the EEA
ZWSOFT operates mainly in China, which is the "Third Country" under the GDPR. Third Countries are widely considered unable to provide the data protection at the level same as the EU. However, ZWSOFT will provide you adequate level of protection as in these countries.
We guarantee that our service providers shall be certified according to the EU–U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and all Personal Data from the EU members shall be processed in line with the Privacy Shield Framework or we have entered into a contract with these states to provide an adequate level of protection for your data in strict accordance with the contract provisions.
User Profiles
We will use your data for "Profiling". This means that we use your data to help us serve you, understand how users use our Websites, products and to provide and enhance your user experience. However, we will never process and analyze your Personal Data in the context of Profiling in a way that would lead to an automated decision legally binding upon you, or that would significantly impair you similarly.
