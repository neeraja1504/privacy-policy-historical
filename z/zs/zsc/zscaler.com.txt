Accordingly, any references to “Policy” includes Zscaler’s GDPR and Privacy Shield Policy. If you are located in the European Union, you have additional rights under the GDPR as set forth in our GDPR and Privacy Shield Policy.
Please read this Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use the Website. By accessing or using the Website or otherwise providing your information to Zscaler, you agree to this Policy.

Information We Collect Through Automatic Data Collection Technologies
We use cookies and various traffic tracking technologies to monitor use of the Website. A cookie is a small piece of data (text file) that a website, when visited by a user, asks your browser to store on your device in order to remember information about you, such as your language preference or login information.
On the Website, we may use cookies to analyze our site traffic patterns, but except as described below under “Agents and Service Providers,” we link cookies only to IP addresses and not to any other personally identifiable information about visitors to the Website. For example, we currently use third party services such as Google Analytics to analyze traffic to the Website. These third party services use cookies to track non-personally identifiable information, link cookies only to IP addresses, and aggregate data about traffic to the Website.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. Please consult your web browser's manual or online help tool if you want information on restricting or disabling the web browser's handling of cookies. If you disable cookies, you can still view the Website, but some features may not be available (such as offers regarding Products).
Web beacons, tags and scripts may be used on the Website or in email or other electronic communications we send to you. These technologies assist us in delivering cookies, counting visits to the Website, understanding usage and marketing campaign effectiveness, and determining whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our third party service providers on an individual and aggregated basis.
We may use Local Storage Objects (“LSOs”) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. Third parties with which we partner to provide certain features on the Website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML5 and Flash to collect and store information.
As is true with most websites and services delivered over the Internet, we gather certain information and store it in log files when you interact with the Website or use our Products. This information includes iIP addresses as well as browser type, internet service provider, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, information you search for, locale and language preferences, identification numbers associated with your devices, your mobile carrier, and system configuration information. Occasionally, we connect personal information to information gathered in our log files as necessary to improve the Website and Products. In such a case, we would treat the combined information in accordance with this Policy.
For more information on how we use cookies and other similar technologies, please refer to our Cookies Policy.

We may disclose your personal information to a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Zscaler's assets, whether as a going concern or as part of a bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by Zscaler about our users is among the assets transferred. In such a case, we will provide notice before your personal information is transferred to a third party and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
We also may share your information, including personal information, with any affiliate of Zscaler for purposes of providing the Products to you.
