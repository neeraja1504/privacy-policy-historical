The Site (including the Game (as defined in the EULA) may incorporate technology (which may be provided by Frontier or third party service providers engaged by Frontier (each a "Dynamic Advertising Provider")) which enables advertising to be displayed in the Game on your device, and changed while the Game is being played online. In order that the Dynamic Advertising Provider is able to direct advertising appropriate to your Game and geographic region, as well as to the correct location within the Game, certain non-personally identifiable data and information may be retrieved and retained by the Dynamic Advertising Provider including your IP address, geographic location, in-game position, and information concerning the appearance of advertising visible during your gameplay (for example, the length of time an item of advertising was visible and the dimensions of the advertisements). In addition, the Dynamic Advertising Provider may assign a unique identification number which is stored on your device and which is used to monitor and calculate the number of views of dynamic advertising during gameplay. None of the information collected for this purpose including the identification number can be used to identify you.
Where a Game incorporates dynamic advertising technology, the technology which serves the provision of dynamic in-game advertising is integrated within the Game.
