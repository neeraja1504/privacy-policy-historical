Zacks Privacy Policy - Zacks Investment Research
Privacy Policy and Terms of Service
Welcome to Zacks.com. Zacks Investment Research and/or its affiliates provide Zacks.com to you subject to the following Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
Privacy Policy
Since our inception in 1978, we have sought long-term relationships with our customers. This means that customer data privacy and security are a top priority. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we gather from your use of this service (the "Service"), how we use it, with whom we might share it, how we keep it secure, and the choices you have about the information you choose to share with us.
Types of Personal Information We Collect:
The types of personal information ("Personal Information") we collect depend on the product or service you receive from us. This information may include, but is not limited to:
Your name, phone number, physical and e-mail address
Your credit card number
Information about your preferences and usage gathered by cookies
Why we Collect Personal Information:
Zacks Investment Research collects Personal Information to provide you with the Service, to perform marketing and research related activities, to supply other administrative services (e.g., setting up new accounts and maintaining your existing account), and to respond to inquiries about your account and the Service.
How we Collect Personal Information:
We collect Personal Information by voluntary submissions from through our website. We also collect Personal Information regarding how you use the Service through cookies, as described more fully below.
How we Use Your Personal Information:
Zacks Investment Research Internal List
Everyone who submits Personal Information to Zacks Investment Research online will receive, via e-mail, our free weekly newsletters: Profit from the Pros. Through Profit from the Pros, we provide original and exclusive content from Zacks Investment Research and Zacks.com. We also distribute commentary and investment ideas from independent third parties, who produce financial news publications and who compensate Zacks Investment Research for distributing their newsletters. From time-to-time, we will also send or contact you regarding special offers for products and services from Zacks Investment Research and our affiliates.
You can unsubscribe from these e-mails at any time by going to register.zacks.com/unisub.php.
Zacks Investment Research Opt-In Marketing List
During the Zacks.com registration process, we include the contact information you provide us on the Zacks Investment Research opt-in marketing list. We "rent" our opt-in marketing list to outside marketers who have special offers that may be of interest to you. Please note that we "rent" our marketing list, but we do not sell your information to third parties. Zacks Investment Research controls the process through an agreement with an e-mail service provider, which handles the distribution of e-mails from Zacks Investment Research and its business partners. We keep tight control over our marketing list at all times. We only give outside marketers the right to send you an e-mail through our e-mail service provider. Additionally, Zacks Investment Research is selective about which companies we permit to send you an offer. Zacks will use names for Market Research. Our goal is for the e-mails to be of value to you.
You can unsubscribe from these e-mails at any time by going to register.zacks.com/unisub.php.
Zacks Investment Research Postal and Telemarketing Lists
Everyone who submits personal postal and phone number information to Zacks Investment Research online may receive special direct mail and telemarketing offers from outside marketers that may be of interest to you. As with our other lists, we "rent" our postal and phone marketing lists and do not sell your information to third parties. Zacks Investment Research controls the process through an agreement with a postal list service bureau and phone call centers, which handles the distribution of direct mail and telemarketing offers from Zacks Investment Research and its business partners. Outside marketers are only given the right to send you a piece of direct mail through our bureau or call you through a telemarketing firm with our approval. All phone numbers on the Zacks telemarketing list are processed through the National Do Not Call Directory to remove anyone registered there. Zacks Investment Research is selective about the companies we permit to send your offers and the offers being sent.
You can unsubscribe from these direct marketing offers at any time by calling us at 1-800-767-3771 ext. 9339 or emailing your request to support@zacks.com.
Zacks Premium
If you subscribe to the Zacks Premium subscription service, you will be included in our internal email and postal marketing lists. You will only be added to the Opt-In Marketing list if you do not uncheck the offer box included as part of registration. We collect your credit card information solely for payment of your subscription. It is shared only with our credit card processor in order to complete the transaction.
Co-Registration
In various registration processes on the Zacks web site, we offer you the opportunity to take free offers from third-party publishers by checking an "opt-in" box by each offer. If you check any box to receive an offer, your name, email address, and/or mailing address will be shared with the appropriate publisher.
Paid Expert Newsletters
If you decide to subscribe to any of our paid newsletters, we collect your credit card information solely for payment of your subscription, and it is shared only with our credit card processor to complete the transaction.
Do Not Email Lists
If you opt out from a Zacks.com Opt-In Marketing List, Zacks Investment Research Internal List, or unsubscribe from a Zacks offer sent by another list vendor, you will be added to our Do Not Email list, and we will suppress your email address from future mailings to the Zacks Investment Research Internal List and Opt-In Marketing List, as well as any other Zacks mailings done through a third party. This process usually completes within 72 hours but can take up to 10 days in rare situations. However, if you later register for a Zacks product again, your name will be removed from the Do Not Email list.
Please note that while Zacks will not freely distribute the information you submit, if you click to unsubscribe from mailings sent to the Zacks.com Opt-In Marketing List from a particular marketer, we are obligated to share your email address with that marketer for the purpose of being added to their Do Not Mail list. How that mailer manages your email address after that time is beyond Zacks.com control.
