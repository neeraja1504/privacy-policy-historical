Cookies. The Zagat Sites employ cookies (small pieces of text stored on your computer) to recognize you and your access privileges and to collect anonymous traffic data. For example, we use cookies to allow you to log on to the Zagat Sites automatically without requiring that you enter your email and password each time you visit the Zagat Sites. Cookies also identify you and your preferences on our site. For these purposes, these cookies are tied to your personally identifiable information. You may refuse to accept our cookies, but we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user or Premium Member, which will limit your access to the site.
We also use cookies to collect anonymous traffic data. These cookies may be placed by us or third party service providers who provide services to Zagat (for example, in connection with monitoring and recording traffic).
Location. If you choose to enter a street address when selecting a location, this information will be saved for your convenience in your Recent Locations list. This information may make it easier for you to browse and search our content and will not be used for any other purpose.
Tell a Friend. If you choose to email or SMS a list, review or link to a friend from the Zagat Sites, we collect the friend's name, e-mail address, and/or mobile phone number. This information is used only to deliver a one-time message to your friend and is not stored on our servers. If "a friend" decides that he/she will register with the Zagat Sites, he or she will be given the same rights of access as registered users of the Zagat Sites. The prospect information that you submit for "a friend" will be used only for the use for which it is submitted. Additionally, for "a friend" to register, he or she will have to follow the Zagat Site's registration process (see above) and will be given the same option in regard to receiving marketing materials that the Zagat Sites offer to all registered users.
IP Addresses. ZAGAT.com logs IP addresses, or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes.

How We Use Your Information
We use your e-mail address and home address to send you updates and newsletters periodically about new features, special offers and targeted promotional items available on the Zagat Sites and to request that you complete restaurant surveys. You may choose to not receive certain of these communications by so indicating during the registration process or in response to one of our e-mails or postal mailings. Each communication will explain how to opt out of future communications. Any demographic information that you voluntarily share with us is used to tailor the Zagat Sites to your interests. We also may share this demographic information with other companies with which we do business.
With Whom We Share Information
We share your personally identifiable information with intermediaries and data processors. These intermediaries and data processors use your information in connection with performing the services for which we have engaged them, including, by way of example, to process payments for online purchases, to deliver e-mail and postal mailings to our users who have chosen to receive such communications and to process restaurant reservations you make through the Zagat Sites. We do not permit these intermediaries or data processors to use, store or retain personally identifiable information for secondary purposes, unless they indicate otherwise in communications to you. Some intermediaries and data processors have the right to use aggregated, non-personally-identifiable information, for example, in order to improve the delivery or quality of their services. Some of these intermediaries and data processors may perform their functions from outside of the United States.
In connection with the restaurant reservation services, your personally identifiable information will be transmitted to the relevant restaurant in order for them to honor your booking. Such restaurants may use your personally identifiable information in connection with their operations and services. You should contact the restaurants directly to obtain information on their privacy practices.
From time to time we may allow some of our select partners to send you special promotional offers that we believe may be of special interest to you. You may choose not to receive these communications from our partners by visiting your email preferences section of your account or in response to any of these communications, each of which will explain how to opt out of future communications. You may also opt out of having your personal information shared with these third parties by sending a request to have your user account deactivated via 'Ask a Question' in our online Help section. If you do so, however, you will not be able to take advantage of many of our features, including the right to vote online, make restaurant reservations through the Zagat Sites, purchase items from our store and even continue as a subscriber to the Zagat Sites.
We make use of certain tracking technology designed to enhance your browsing experience and provide analytics. These technologies, provided as a hosted service application, provide aggregate reporting information to the site owner only, through cookies that they set at the Zagat Sites. No personal or personally identifiable information is gathered for this process.
We do retain the right to share and transfer all user information with a purchaser of our company or all or substantially all of our assets if that purchaser agrees to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Legal Disclaimer
We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform with the law or legal process or to protect or defend our rights or property.
Security
The Zagat Sites have security measures in place to help protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All information is stored in a secure operating environment. When sending sensitive information across the Internet - including your email, password and purchasing information such as credit cards - we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. Internally, all customer information is protected with multiple security checks. Employee access to the system is limited to the functionality necessary for each person's job. Relevant employees are informed of our security policies and their access to applications and data on our network.
If you still do not feel comfortable about leaving your credit card information on our secured Web site, please contact our customer service department at (800) 540-9609 and we'll be happy to help you with your order or subscription.

If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for Zagat Sites or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to Zagat Survey. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we may have any information from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us.
