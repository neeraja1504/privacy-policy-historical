Zarafa Privacy Policy | www.zarafa.com
Purpose and Scope
This policy discloses what information we gather when visiting zarafa.com or buy products directly from us. It describes how we use that information and how you can control it.
Information Zarafa gathers and tracks
Zarafa collects two kinds of information from users:
data which users volunteer by signing up to receive news and product information, entering contests, completing surveys, or buying directly from us;
aggregated tracking data we collect when users interact with Zarafa.
Personal information
We use the personal information you provide voluntarily to send information you've requested and to fulfill orders. The specific use of your personal information varies, depending on the way you contact us:
When you subscribe to Zarafa mailing lists to receive Zarafa news and product information, you must provide email address. We never sell or rent your email address you provide when subscribing to our lists. Please note that Zarafa mailing lists are archived by several third party sites and your email address can be found from their archives. Zarafa doesn't have control over those archives.
When you order Zarafa commercial licenses, or purchase commercial support, or buy training, we add you to our mailing lists and will contact you in Zarafa related issues now and then.
When you enter a contest or survey, we may ask for your name, address, and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.

This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
