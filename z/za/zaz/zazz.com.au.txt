Personal information is information or an opinion about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can be reasonably ascertained, from that information or opinion. Personal information we may collect from you includes, without limitation, your name, address, email address, telephone number(s) and date of birth.

3. Collection
Kogan will collect personal information only by lawful and fair means and not in an unreasonably intrusive way. If it is reasonable and practical to do so, Kogan will only collect personal information about you directly from you. Kogan may collect your personal information from reputable third party lead generation sources for marketing purposes, but only where you have consented to the disclosure of your information to Kogan and for Kogan to send you marketing communications. Kogan will not collect personal information unless the information is reasonably necessary for our functions and activities.
Personal information may be collected by Kogan in a number of circumstances, including when you:
make an enquiry with us via email or telephone;
visit our websites;
lodge an enquiry or application in relation to any Kogan products or services; or
apply for employment with Kogan.
Kogan may enter into arrangements with third parties (including third parties with whom Kogan has partnered to provide you with its various products or services using the Kogan brand) to collect your personal information in circumstances where the third party notifies you, at the time of collection, that your personal information will be provided to Kogan.
If you are applying for a product or service offered on Koganmoney.com.au, Kogan or our third party partners may also collect credit-related personal information about you as a result of credit checks that third parties carry out in connection with your application.
The kinds of credit-related personal information Kogan may collect about you includes:
information about your identity;
information about consumer credit loans that you currently have applied for including:
repayment history information;
the type and amount of credit sought in each application;
default and payment information;
information about any court proceedings;
credit eligibility information, which is credit reporting information supplied to us by a credit reporting body, and any information that we derive from it.
If you use a pseudonym when dealing with us or you do not provide identifiable information Kogan may not be able to provide you with any or all of our services as requested. If you wish to remain anonymous when you use our website do not sign into it or provide any information that might identify you.
Kogan requires individuals to provide accurate, up-to-date and complete personal information at the time it is collected.
4. What does Kogan do with your personal information?
In addition to any purpose notified to you at the time of collection Kogan uses your personal information for the purpose for which it has been provided, for reasonably related secondary purposes and for the purposes of:
providing our products and services to you;

Kogan will not charge you for correcting your personal information.
If Kogan no longer needs your personal information for any the purposes set out in this policy, or as otherwise required by law, Kogan will take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to destroy the information or to de-identify it.
Kogan will take reasonable steps to protect the personal information it holds from misuse, interference and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
