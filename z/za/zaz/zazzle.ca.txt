Any Content or other information you upload that is visible to third parties may be read, collected, and used by others who access the relevant webpage(s). Our blog is managed by a third party application,  WordPress, and does not require you to register to post a comment to a post. Commenting is moderated by Zazzle blog administrators and is subject to approval before appearing on the Site. You will need to contact Zazzle if you want the personal information that was posted to the comments section removed. To learn how WordPress uses your information, please review their privacy policy.

Information collected by Cookies:
Zazzle uses cookies on the Site to improve the quality of our Site and services to you. We use cookies for several purposes, in order to offer a fast and safe digital experience, for example, allowing to maintain an active connection during navigation through the Site pages; to store credentials in a safe mode; and to identify the Site pages that have already been visited, in order to prevent them from being proposed again.
A cookie is a small text file that our Site sends to your computer to allow the Site to store information that uniquely identifies our Users. Zazzle's cookies do not collect or store personally identifiable information. Rather, the cookie stores a token that uniquely identifies a particular User at a particular time. That token is then linked to the User information in our secured databases. You can always delete the cookies and reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to display a message when a cookie is being sent. If you reset your browser, some of the Site features and functionality may not be available to you and you may not be able to take advantage of all the features on the Site.
We may work with other companies that place cookies or web beacons on our Site. We do not have access or control over these cookies. These companies help operate our websites and provide you with additional Products and services. They are subject to confidentiality agreements with Zazzle and other legal restrictions. Zazzle does not permit any of these companies to collect personally identifiable information using cookies or web beacons on our Site. Certain functionalities related to the provision of additional Products and services require marketers to share website usage information about visitors to the Site, who have received a targeted promotional campaign, with a reputable third-party advertising company for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. To this end, Zazzle's third-party advertising company makes a note of some of the pages you visit on the Site through the use of pixel tags. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
Information collected by Web Beacons and Log Files:
Zazzle collects IP addresses and certain non-personally identifiable information through the use of web beacons and log files. Such information may include your browser type, Site usage, and whether you opened emails you received from us.
Information collected through Product Reviews:
You may choose to submit a Product review. If you post a review, we may ask for certain information to validate your review such as an email address, photo, and your city/state/country of residence. If you submit a review, we may publish your geographic location or other anonymous information but your email address will be kept private. Additionally, any personally identifiable information that you submit as part of the review can be read or used by other visitors to the Site. We are not responsible for any personally identifiable information that you choose to submit as part of your review. We believe you can post a helpful review without disclosing any personally identifiable information. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at privacy@zazzle.com.
How do we secure your information?
When you place orders or access your Account information, we use commercially reasonable and generally-accepted technological safeguards to secure any information we collect about you. The transport layer security software (" TLS ") we use encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. In addition, your Zazzle Account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. You should always take steps to protect the confidentiality of the password you select. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.
We operate internationally and many of our computer systems are currently based in the United States. As a result, your personal data will be processed by us (and third parties on our behalf as further described in this Privacy Policy) in the United States where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create a User Account with us, you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all information you provide to us in and to the United States.
You may also choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our Site because such information may be required in order for you to: register as a member; purchase Products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our Site.
We work very hard to protect your privacy, but we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain private. While we use industry-standard precautions to safeguard your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee complete security.
How do we use your information?
We use the personally identifiable information you provide to:
• provide the features and functionality of the Site;
• fulfill your requests for our Products and services;
• pay Earnings;
• communicate with you about the status of your orders and other inquiries about our Products and services;
• send you information about our products and services;
• for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits and so forth;
• help us create Site content that is most relevant to you; and
• provide notices about the results of sweepstakes, contest, and other promotions.
We use your email address to communicate with you about your Account and to send you certain notification emails. You can change the frequency of those emails in your Zazzle Account settings.
When you purchase Products from the Site, we may use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send marketing messages and notifications from time-to-time, whether or not you created an account with us. You may unsubscribe or change the frequency of email notifications on the Account Settings page in "My Account." If you (i) email a Product to a friend, (ii) invite a friend to a Collaboration, or (iii) refer a friend to the Site or our promotions, we will use your friend's email address to send them the e-mail you requested. Your friend's e-mail addresses will only be used for this purpose, unless permission is otherwise granted. Zazzle does not store this information. Your friend may contact us at privacy@zazzle.com to request that we remove this information from our database.
We use non-personally identifiable information to monitor the use and performance of the Site so that we can learn more about how people use the Site, which information helps us improve our Products and services and significantly enhance your experience on our Site.
Does Zazzle disclose the information it collects to outside parties?
We will share your personally identifiable information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. We do not sell your personally identifiable information to third parties. Generally, Zazzle does not share personally identifiable information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies without your consent except that:
1. Zazzle provides information to its agents and trusted service providers and contractors for limited purposes, such as fulfilling customer orders and processing credit card transactions; offering certain Products and services; communicating with customers; providing customer service; managing information on our behalf; and enhancing the Site features and functionality. In such cases, we require that these parties agree to use the information solely for the purpose for which we provided it to them and in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
2. If you sign up for a promotion (e.g., a contest or sweepstakes offer) or enroll in a service we offer in partnership with a third party, we may provide information (such as your name, email address, and Account activity) to such third parties.
3. Zazzle provides its Designers with the first name and city/state/country of residence of Zazzle customers who have purchased such Designer's Products. Zazzle may also release information (including your name, addresses, telephone number, and Account activity) when we, in our sole discretion believe that such release is necessary or appropriate to:
• comply with law;
• comply with subpoenas, warrants, court orders, government investigations, or other legal process;
• enforce or apply the provisions of any of our User Agreement or Policies;
• investigate or respond to allegations of fraud, intellectual property infringement, or other unlawful activity;
• investigate fraud or similar claims;
• protect the rights, property or safety of Zazzle, our Users, or others;
• protect our operations; or
• permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
In the event that Zazzle is acquired by or merges with another company, Zazzle reserves the right to transfer, in connection with such acquisition or merger, all information we have collected from our Users. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.
Zazzle may disclose non-personally-identifiable information to third parties in aggregate form or to potential business partners and investors, in each instance in accordance with GDPR.
Zazzle will obtain assurances from its agents that they will only process the data for the limited and specified purposes consistent with the consent provided by the individual and will safeguard personal information consistently with this Privacy Policy. The assurance may include: a contract binding the agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Privacy Shield Principles, being subject to GDPR, or Privacy Shield certification by the agent.
Advertising
Zazzle may use third-party service providers to place ads on our behalf across the internet and sometimes on the Site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Site, and your interaction with our Products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a web beacon, which is industry standard technology used by most major sites. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information about you used by our third party service providers, please contact us at privacy@zazzle.com.
