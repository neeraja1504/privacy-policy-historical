|  |  |  Individually Identifiable Information
ZaZa Network, Inc recognizes that the growth of online services, including Internet services, has created many privacy concerns, particularly for consumers.
|
---|---
These concerns focus on protecting "individually identifiable" information that an individual or customer reasonably expects to be kept private. As the term suggests, individually identifiable information is information that can be associated with a specific individual or entity, such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and/or information about online activities directly linked to them.
It is common practice and often a necessity for companies, governments or other organizations to collect individually identifiable information in order to conduct business and offer services. For example, a telecommunications provider may collect individually identifiable information in the course of billing and providing telephone service to a customer.
Some activities on the Internet follow very familiar patterns. Consumers signing up for an Internet access service are usually asked to provide information that is typical when the consumer orders a product or service. Similarly, business Web sites may ask visitors to supply information about themselves, particularly when information, services or merchandise are requested, but often simply to be able to better target the company's services to the customer's interests and requirements.
