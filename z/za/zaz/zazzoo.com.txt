USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Company uses your personal information to identify you and, in some cases, to improve and customize the content you see on the Application. Your personal information may also be aggregated and used by Company for market research, project planning, troubleshooting problems, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity, to enforce the Terms of Use or any applicable Rules, for other internal purposes, and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. Company will obtain your consent for any use of your personal information beyond those set forth in this Privacy Policy and the original uses for which you provided your consent.

You also agree that Company may use your personal information to contact you. Unless you specifically opt out, you also agree that Company may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the Application or the Services. By accepting the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information, unless you specifically opt out in applicable circumstances.
Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in SMS text messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your username (not your email address) may be displayed to other Users when you upload content or send messages through the Application. Any content that you submit to the Application may be redistributed through the Internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.
DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Except as expressly provided herein, absent your prior consent, Company does not share your personal information with any unrelated third parties. Additionally, Company does not permit unrelated third parties to perform "reverse searches" whereby they could identify users from mobile telephone numbers or email addresses. In addition, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide you with the Services:
Profile. Company may post certain information as a part of your User Profile, which will be viewable by other Users and visitors to the site, including but not limited to your username, age, location, and sexual orientation. Company will not disclose your home address, email address, phone number, or full name in connection with your User Profile.
Advertisers. Company may aggregate personal information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, Company does not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally without your explicit consent.
External Service Providers. There are a number of separate services offered by third parties that Company refers to as external service providers that may be complementary to your use of the Application or the Services. If you choose to use these separate services, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy. With your consent, and for your convenience, Company may provide some of your personal information to an external service provider offering such services. To prevent Company's disclosure of your personally identifiable information to an external service provider, you can decline such consent or simply not use their services. Because Company does not control the privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to use their services.
Internal Service Providers. Company may use third parties that Company refers to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of Company's business, products and Services that Company provides to you and, therefore, Company may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers (e.g. customer care). In some instances, the internal service provider may collect information directly from you. In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider. If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your personally identifiable information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company reserves the right, and you authorize Company, to share or disclose your personal information, including, without limitation, any content, records or electronic communications of any kind, when Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the disclosure of your personally identifiable information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against you if:
you are or may be violating the Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy or any applicable Rules;
you are interfering with Company's or a third party's rights or property;
you are violating any applicable law, rule or regulation;
necessary or required by any applicable law, rule or regulation; and/or
requested by governmental authorities in the event of any investigation, act of terrorism or instance of local, regional or national emergency.
In addition, Company cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example, without limiting the foregoing, Company may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access your transmissions or communications. Therefore, although Company uses industry standard practices to protect your privacy, Company does not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain private. However, Company shall use reasonable commercial and legal efforts to protect its users' information and to maintain the privacy and anonymity of Members and users.
In the event of a merger, acquisition, sale of substantially all of its assets or change of control of Company, personal information collected by Company about you will be considered a business asset and will be transferred to the applicable new entity.
