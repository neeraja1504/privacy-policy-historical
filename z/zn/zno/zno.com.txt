Collecting Content Information
Any image uploaded to our server will be automatically collected and saved until deleted by the user who uploaded the image. Any project created will be automatically collected and saved until deleted by the user who created the project. If a project has been ordered it can no longer be deleted.
Using Content Information
On our websites and mobile sites at the end of checkout on the confirmation page a user will be given the voluntary option to authorize Zno to share the images contained in that order on Zno's social media and promotional material. Authorization allows Zno to share one or all images from that order at any time in the future and to alter the size of images to fit social media or other media. Zno is not responsible for users who accidentally authorize images to be shared. Zno is not responsible for water marking images before sharing. Zno is not responsible for incorrectly attributing images. Zno is not responsible for other social media users or website users who download or share images that are featured in Zno's social media or websites without owners permission. Zno will attempt to delete images from social media and websites under Zno's control after posting if subsequently requested by owner, but if images cannot be found or deleted Zno is not responsible.
If the owner of a project shares their project using the "share url" or "embed code" we are not responsible for where the project is distributed.
Zno reserves the right to delete any images that you upload if Zno determines that your images are inappropriate for any reason, scenarios may include copyrighted or pornographic images. We are not responsible for providing copies of these deleted images.

Security
